### Neuro-Symbolic Record Linkage (v0.109.0 – v0.111.0)

> **Foundation document**: see [plans/neuro-symbolic-record-linkage.md](plans/neuro-symbolic-record-linkage.md) for the full competitive analysis, 21-synergy breakdown, deployment patterns, evaluation methodology, and production concerns. The three versions below close the gaps identified in §15 of that document, delivering a complete in-database NS-RL platform on top of the symbolic/neural substrate that shipped in v0.10.0–v0.49.0.

| Version | Theme | Status | Scope | Full details |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|-------------- |
| [v0.109.0](roadmap/v0.109.0.md) | **NS-RL foundation: string similarity builtins + high-level orchestrator** — expose `pg_trgm` trigram similarity, `levenshtein()`, `soundex()`, and `metaphone()` as SPARQL FILTER functions (`pg:trigram_similarity(?a, ?b)`, `pg:levenshtein(?a, ?b)`, `pg:soundex(?s)`, `pg:metaphone(?s, ?maxlen)`) and equivalent Datalog built-in predicates, enabling symbolic matching rules such as `FILTER(pg:trigram_similarity(?name1, ?name2) > 0.85)` without leaving SPARQL; **`pg_ripple.resolve_entities(source_graph TEXT, target_graph TEXT, options JSONB DEFAULT '{}') → JSONB`** high-level orchestrator that runs the full five-stage NS-RL pipeline in one call: (1) blocking via `infer('owl-rl')` on declared `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty` predicates, (2) embedding-based candidate generation via `suggest_sameas()`, (3) SHACL shape validation gate, (4) `owl:sameAs` canonicalization, (5) RDF-star provenance annotation; options include `blocking_rules TEXT` (Datalog rule set to use for blocking), `confidence_threshold FLOAT8 DEFAULT 0.85`, `dry_run BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`; `dry_run` mode returns the candidate pairs that would be asserted without writing to the triple store; **built-in ER blocking templates** via `pg_ripple.er_blocking_templates() → TABLE(name TEXT, rule TEXT)`: three reusable Datalog rule families (postal-code block, email exact-match block, name-prefix block) that cover ~80% of common ER patterns and can be loaded with `load_rules(pg_ripple.er_blocking_template('email'), 'er')` ; **security**: `pg_ripple.sameas_apply_rate_limit` GUC (default: 1000 per second) limits how many `owl:sameAs` triples a single `resolve_entities()` call may assert — calls exceeding the limit raise PT0460; **worked examples**: three pg_regress–backed SQL cookbooks covering healthcare patient matching, enterprise customer deduplication, and Datalog-based blocking (NS-RL-01 through NS-RL-03); migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.108.0--0.109.0.sql` | **Released ✅** | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.109.0.md) |
| [v0.110.0](roadmap/v0.110.0.md) | **NS-RL evaluation harness, continuous monitoring, and rule explainability** — **`pg_ripple.evaluate_resolution(gold_graph TEXT, pipeline_options JSONB DEFAULT '{}') → JSONB`**: runs the configured NS-RL pipeline against a gold-standard named graph of human-verified matches, returns pairwise precision/recall/F1, blocking pairs-completeness/reduction-ratio/F-PQ, and B³ cluster precision/recall — all three metric axes from the evaluation methodology in §14 of the NS-RL plan; **Magellan ER benchmark CI gate**: `benchmarks/er_magellan.sh` loads the Abt-Buy and DBLP-ACM datasets as RDF, runs `resolve_entities()`, computes F1 against bundled ground truth, fails CI on any run below Splink baseline (Abt-Buy F1 ≥ 0.78, DBLP-ACM F1 ≥ 0.90); **streaming resolution latency gate**: `benchmarks/er_freshness.sh` inserts 1K entity records at 100 rec/s and asserts that p95 symbolic-match latency stays below 500 ms; **live monitoring stream tables**: `_pg_ripple.er_unresolved_entities` (SPARQL-compiled, 5 s schedule), `_pg_ripple.er_cluster_sizes` (union-find statistics, 30 s schedule), and `_pg_ripple.er_resolution_dashboard` (aggregate counts, 10 s schedule) created by `pg_ripple.enable_er_monitoring()`; **`pg_ripple.explain_rule(rule_id BIGINT, format TEXT DEFAULT 'text') → TEXT`**: retrieves the Datalog rule from `_pg_ripple.rules`, narrates it in plain English via the LLM endpoint, and caches the result in `_pg_ripple.rule_explanations (rule_id, language, explanation, generated_at)` with a TTL controlled by `pg_ripple.rule_explanation_cache_ttl` GUC — returning the cached version when fresh; when the LLM endpoint is unavailable, falls back to a template-driven structural description (rule name, head predicate, body predicate list) rather than failing; REST endpoint `GET /rules/{id}/explain` in `pg_ripple_http`; **anomaly detection**: `_pg_ripple.sameas_anomaly_log (detected_at, entity1, entity2, cluster_size_before, cluster_size_after, trigger TEXT)` records any `owl:sameAs` assertion that would exceed `pg_ripple.sameas_max_cluster_size` (PT550) — also persisted on disk so forensic queries survive after the triggering transaction is rolled back; migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.109.0--0.110.0.sql` | ✅ Released | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.110.0.md) |
| [v0.111.0](roadmap/v0.111.0.md) | **Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) primitives** — Bloom-filter-based encoding for cross-organization entity resolution without exchanging raw PII (Schnell et al. 2009; Christen et al. 2020): **`pg_ripple.bloom_encode(value TEXT, key TEXT, hash_count INT DEFAULT 30, length INT DEFAULT 1024) → BIT VARYING`** implementing the standard CLK (Cryptographic Longterm Key) construction using HMAC-SHA-256 (via `pgcrypto`) with `hash_count` independent hash functions; input length validated against `pg_ripple.bloom_max_input_length` GUC (default: 4096 bytes) — longer inputs raise PT0470; **`pg:dice_similarity(a BIT VARYING, b BIT VARYING) → FLOAT8`** SPARQL FILTER function and Datalog built-in computing Dice coefficient on bit strings, enabling cross-org candidate detection without raw-value exchange; **`pg_ripple.dp_noisy_count(query TEXT, epsilon FLOAT8) → BIGINT`** and **`pg_ripple.dp_noisy_histogram(query TEXT, epsilon FLOAT8) → TABLE`** for Laplace-mechanism differential-privacy noise on aggregate ER queries — epsilon validated to the range `(0.0, 10.0]`; **SSRF-safe PPRL federation pattern**: documentation chapter `docs/src/cookbook/pprl.md` with a worked example showing Bloom-filter triples stored in each org's own named graph, exchanged only as encoded vectors via SPARQL `SERVICE` federation, with dice-similarity threshold filtering; **proptest**: `bloom_encode` round-trip property — `dice_similarity(bloom_encode(v, k, h, l), bloom_encode(v, k, h, l)) = 1.0` for any input; negative property — encoding different values with the same key produces similarity < 1.0 with overwhelming probability for reasonable parameters; **security note**: Bloom-filter CLK encodings with fewer than 30 hash functions or length < 1024 bits may be reversible — these limits are enforced by default and documented; migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.110.0--0.111.0.sql` | ✅ Released | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.111.0.md) |

### Pre-GA Feature Expansion (v0.124.0 – v0.127.0)

> These three versions ship the three highest-priority new features from [plans/PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_17.md §11](plans/PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_17.md): SPARQL 1.2 property path algebra execution (FEAT-01), temporal graph snapshots with time-travel SPARQL (FEAT-02), and per-endpoint federation credentials with OAuth2 and API-key support (FEAT-03). They run in parallel with the external security audit and 72-hour load test preparation required for v1.0.0 GA.

| Version | Theme | Status | Scope | Full details |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|-------------- |
| [v0.124.0](roadmap/v0.124.0.md) | **SPARQL 1.2 property path algebra execution (FEAT-01)** — `spargebra` and `sparopt` already have `features = ["sparql-12", "sep-0006"]` enabled (`Cargo.toml:30–31`); this release wires execution: implement bidirectional inverse path (`^p`), path alternatives at the operator level (`p1&#124;p2` beyond simple IRI union), zero-or-one quantifier (`p?`) via `OPTIONAL`-based unrolling, negated property sets (`!(p1&#124;p2)`), and nested inverse sequences in `src/sparql/property_path.rs`; extend the `WITH RECURSIVE … CYCLE` template for all new operator combinations ensuring all paths use PostgreSQL 18's `CYCLE` clause for hash-based cycle detection; emit `PT0501 ERROR: SPARQL 1.2 path operator not yet supported` for any unimplemented variant so gaps are explicit rather than silently incorrect; add 20 pg_regress test cases covering each new operator and five key combinations (inverse-sequence, alternation with quantifier, negated-with-inverse, nested inverse, cycle detection); add 5 OWL 2 RL property-chain tests exercising n-hop recursive `owl:propertyChainAxiom` (n=4, n=5) via the new path engine; update `docs/src/reference/sparql12-status.md` with per-feature execution-status table; update W3C SPARQL 1.2 tracking issue in GitHub; add migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.123.0--0.124.0.sql` (no schema changes) | Released ✅ | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.124.0.md) |
| [v0.125.0](roadmap/v0.125.0.md) | **Temporal graph snapshots — point-in-time named graphs (FEAT-02)** — `pg_ripple.graph_at(graph_iri TEXT, snapshot_time TIMESTAMPTZ) → TEXT` SQL function that materialises a named-graph snapshot from `_pg_ripple.temporal_facts` at the given timestamp and registers it in `_pg_ripple.graph_snapshots (snapshot_id BIGINT DEFAULT nextval('snapshot_id_seq') PRIMARY KEY, graph_iri TEXT NOT NULL, snapshot_iri TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, captured_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL, triple_count BIGINT, expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ)`; time-travel SPARQL via `GRAPH <snapshot-iri> { … }` pattern routed to snapshot data (read-only VP scan of snapshotted named graph, no write path); `pg_ripple.snapshot_retention_days` GUC (default 30) for automatic snapshot GC via background merge-worker tick; `pg_ripple.graph_diff(graph_iri TEXT, from_ts TIMESTAMPTZ, to_ts TIMESTAMPTZ) → TABLE(s BIGINT, p BIGINT, o BIGINT, change TEXT)` returning `'added'`/`'removed'` delta rows enabling audit-compliance workflows and incremental Turtle/N-Quads exports; `GET /temporal/graphs/{iri}/snapshot?at=<iso8601>` HTTP endpoint returning snapshot content as Turtle; `GET /temporal/graphs/{iri}/diff?from=<iso8601>&to=<iso8601>` HTTP endpoint returning N-Quads delta; Prometheus gauge `pg_ripple_graph_snapshots_total` tracking live snapshot count; 15 pg_regress tests covering snapshot creation, time-travel SPARQL query, diff export delta correctness, retention GC row deletion, and concurrent snapshot creation race; blog post `blog/temporal-graph-snapshots.md`; add migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.124.0--0.125.0.sql` adding `graph_snapshots` table and `snapshot_id_seq` sequence | Released ✅ | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.125.0.md) |
| [v0.126.0](roadmap/v0.126.0.md) | **Per-endpoint federation credentials — OAuth2 Bearer and API-key (FEAT-03)** — `_pg_ripple.federation_credentials (endpoint_iri TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES _pg_ripple.federation_endpoints, auth_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (auth_type IN ('bearer','apikey','none')), encrypted_token BYTEA NOT NULL, header_name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Authorization', created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(), rotated_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` table with tokens stored via `pgcrypto pgp_sym_encrypt` using a server-managed symmetric key configured in `pg_ripple.federation_credential_key` GUC (never logged, never visible via `SHOW`); `pg_ripple.set_federation_credential(endpoint_iri TEXT, auth_type TEXT, token TEXT) → void` SQL function (SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = pg_ripple, _pg_ripple, public) that encrypts the token before insert/update; reqwest-based federation call path in `src/sparql/federation/execute.rs` decrypts and injects the `Authorization: Bearer …` or custom API-key header per-request at query time, never caching the plaintext; `pg_ripple.rotate_federation_credential(endpoint_iri TEXT, new_token TEXT) → void` for zero-downtime token rotation via atomic UPDATE; `pg_ripple.federation_credential_audit() → TABLE(endpoint_iri TEXT, auth_type TEXT, token_age_days FLOAT8, last_used_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` for operational audit without exposing plaintext tokens; `GET /federation/{endpoint}/auth-status` HTTP endpoint (write-auth required) returning credential age and auth type; SSRF guard validates endpoint URI *before* credential lookup so attackers cannot use credential oracle for SSRF probing; 10 pg_regress tests covering credential storage, injection verification via mock SPARQL endpoint, rotation atomicity, audit query (no plaintext), SSRF bypass prevention with credentials present; add migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.125.0--0.126.0.sql` adding `federation_credentials` table | ✅ Released | Large | [Full details](roadmap/v0.126.0.md) |
| [v0.127.0](roadmap/v0.127.0.md) | **pg_tide relay migration cleanup** — move CDC bridge relay gating from `has_pg_trickle()` to `has_pg_tide()`; add `pg_ripple.relay_available()` while retaining deprecated `trickle_available()` as a compatibility alias; change `_pg_ripple.cdc_bridge_trigger_fn()` from dynamic table inserts into pg-trickle-style outbox tables to `tide.outbox_publish(outbox_name, payload, headers)` with stable `ripple:{statement_id}` dedup metadata; add `_pg_ripple.cdc_bridge_triggers.outbox_name` while retaining `outbox_table` as a compatibility alias; update operations guides, BIDI runbooks, examples, and Docker snippets to use pg_tide's `pg-tide` command, `ghcr.io/trickle-labs/pg-tide` image, `PG_TIDE_POSTGRES_URL`, and stable `tide.relay_set_outbox_v2` / `tide.relay_set_inbox_v2` configuration APIs; bump bundled/tested pg_tide to 0.33.0; add detailed research plan `pg-tide-relay-fixes.md`; add migration script `sql/pg_ripple--0.126.0--0.127.0.sql` | ✅ Released | Medium | [Full details](roadmap/v0.127.0.md) |

## v1.0.0 GA Entry Criteria (H16-07, v0.112.0)

pg_ripple enters general availability (v1.0.0) only when **all** of the following criteria are met.
Each criterion has a corresponding CI gate or documented evidence requirement.

| # | Criterion | Gate / Evidence |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| **(a)** | Zero open High-severity findings for **two consecutive** assessment cycles | Assessment report on file with no unresolved High findings in the current and previous cycle |
| **(b)** | Zero unannotated `unsafe` blocks in the codebase | `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "deny"` enforced in `Cargo.toml`; CI fails on any unannotated `unsafe {}` |
| **(c)** | HTTP companion compatibility window policy **written and enforced by CI** | `RELEASE.md` "HTTP Companion Compatibility Window Policy" section; `release.yml` `compat-check` job fails if floor > 1 minor version behind |
| **(d)** | All pg_regress tests passing on PG18 | `cargo pgrx regress pg18` reports ≥ 271 tests, 0 failures in the `release.yml` CI run |
| **(e)** | Signed SBOM | `pg_ripple.cdx.json` SBOM signed with `cosign` and attached to the GitHub release artifact |
| **(f)** | External security-review report on file | TrailOfBits, Cure53, or equivalent third-party audit completed; report linked from the GitHub release and `docs/src/security.md` |

Progress against these criteria is tracked in each assessment report and confirmed before tagging v1.0.0.

```

v0.1.0 through v0.5.1 build the complete core storage and query engine.
v0.6.0 through v0.10.0 add the HTAP architecture, SHACL validation, and the full
Datalog reasoning engine. v0.11.0 through v0.20.0 complete the SPARQL query and
update surfaces and establish the W3C conformance baseline. v0.21.0 through v0.32.0
harden correctness and deliver production-grade Datalog optimizations including
magic sets, semi-naive evaluation, well-founded semantics, and entity resolution.
v0.33.0 through v0.46.0 deliver the documentation site, parallel evaluation,
worst-case optimal joins, full conformance suites, and the AI/LLM integration layer.
v0.47.0 through v0.51.0 complete the architecture refactor and shipping hardening
required for a production release. v0.52.0 through v0.54.0 deliver the pg-trickle
relay integration and high-availability story. v0.55.0 through v0.56.0 address all
open security findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_6 (SSRF allowlist, error-catalog
drift) and add GeoSPARQL 1.1, federation circuit breaker, and the SPARQL audit log.
v0.57.0 through v0.59.0 extend the reasoning platform to OWL 2 EL/QL, add KG
embeddings, entity alignment, temporal RDF queries, Citus sharding with shard-pruning,
and PROV-O provenance. v0.60.0 through v0.62.0 are the pre-1.0 hardening and
ecosystem sprint: v0.60.0 closes the remaining v1.0.0 blockers identified in
PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_7 (HTAP atomic swap, CI supply-chain hardening, fuzz target
gaps, `geof:distance`); v0.61.0 delivers ecosystem depth (per-graph RLS, inference
explainability, GDPR erasure, dbt adapter, SHACL-AF execution, richer federation call stats);
v0.62.0 delivers the query frontier (Arrow Flight bulk export, WCOJ planner
integration, visual graph explorer) plus six Citus scalability improvements (property-path
push-down, `vp_rare` cold-entry archival, tiered dictionary cache, distributed inference
dispatch, live shard rebalance, multi-hop pruning carry-forward). v0.63.0 introduces
SPARQL CONSTRUCT writeback rules: any CONSTRUCT query can be registered as a persistent
rule that writes its derived triples directly into a target named graph inside the VP
storage layer and maintains them incrementally — inserts trigger a delta derivation path,
deletes trigger Delete-Rederive retraction — enabling raw-to-canonical model pipelines
where the canonical graph is always consistent with the latest raw data.
v0.63.0 also delivers eight Citus scalability improvements (CITUS-30–37): SERVICE
result shard pruning, streaming coordinator fan-out via SPARQL cursor, approximate
`COUNT(DISTINCT)` via HyperLogLog, batched dictionary encoding, per-worker statement-ID
local tables, non-blocking VP promotion via shadow-table pattern, per-graph RLS
propagation CI gate, and per-worker BRIN summarise after merge. v0.64.0 through
v0.64.0 through
v0.69.0 convert the findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_8 and PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_9 into explicit
roadmap work: v0.64.0 adds the truth-in-release guardrails (feature status,
deep readiness, immutable CI actions, release digest scanning, and documentation
correction); v0.65.0 closes CONSTRUCT writeback correctness (delta maintenance,
HTAP-aware retraction, exact provenance, and the full behavior test matrix);
v0.66.0 makes the streaming and distributed claims real or explicitly labels
them as planner hints/stubs/helpers (true SPARQL cursors, signed Arrow IPC export,
explainable WCOJ mode, and integrated Citus pruning/HLL/BRIN/RLS/promotion paths);
v0.67.0 addresses all four Critical findings from Assessment 9 (storage mutation
journal closing all CONSTRUCT writeback bypass paths, VP table RLS coverage,
Arrow Flight ticket security and tombstone-aware export, fail-closed release-truth
scripts) and gathers production evidence (soak tests, audit or threat-model closure,
public benchmarks, upgrade/backup acceptance, and mandatory release evidence
artifacts); v0.68.0 completes the distributed execution and streaming contracts
that were labelled partial or planned in v0.62–v0.66 (true CONSTRUCT streaming,
Citus HLL aggregate translation, Citus SERVICE pruning, nonblocking VP promotion,
and scheduled fuzz CI for all twelve targets); and v0.69.0 restructures the large
source modules along single-responsibility boundaries to make the codebase
maintainable for a v1.0.0 API freeze.
v0.70.0 through v0.73.0 address the findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_10:
v0.70.0 closes all four Critical findings (bulk-load mutation journal bypass,
per-triple flush overhead, missing evidence file citations, SHACL-SPARQL docs)
and six High/Medium items (README stale, RLS DDL quoting, SBOM currency, missing
test files, legacy script cleanup, roadmap status correction); v0.71.0 validates
the Arrow Flight streaming contract with an RSS-bounded 10 M-row integration test,
implements the previously-missing Citus RLS propagation integration test, adds an
extension/HTTP companion compatibility matrix, and documents HLL accuracy bounds;
v0.72.0 hardens the mutation journal against PostgreSQL SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK via
xact callbacks, continues the v0.69.0 module split for the three largest remaining
files, adds a ConstructTemplate proptest suite and a SPARQL Update fuzz target,
promotes W3C conformance and BSBM gates to required CI, adds Arrow Flight replay
protection, and tests the Datalog→CWB interaction chain; v0.73.0 tracks SPARQL 1.2,
delivers a live SPARQL subscription API prototype via SSE, and completes the
ecosystem hardening items (CONTRIBUTING.md, Helm chart SHA pinning, feature status
taxonomy, and R2RML scope documentation).
v0.74.0 through v0.76.0 address Assessment 11 findings: evidence-path truthfulness
(twelve doc stubs, CI gate fix), mutation journal wiring for Datalog/R2RML/CDC,
HTTP companion version alignment, unwrap/panic audit, URL parser fuzz target, RLS
hash widening, Rust toolchain pin, and benchmark baseline refresh. v0.77.0 and
v0.78.0 deliver bidirectional RDF integration: source attribution, conflict
resolution, linkback, outbox/inbox transport, per-subscription side-band auth,
write-time redaction, audit trail, and the non-blocking draft RDF Bidirectional
Integration Profile v1. v0.79.0 closes the last two known query-engine limitations
— true Leapfrog Triejoin executor (WCOJ) and full `sh:SPARQLRule` evaluation — so
every `feature_status()` row reads `implemented`. v0.80.0 through v0.83.0 address
all findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_12: critical SQL injection and SSRF
security hardening, property-path cycle detection, SPARQL Update and Datalog
mutation journal wiring, HTAP merge SID determinism, federation URL/truncation
correctness, plan cache GUC completeness, migration chain test assertions through
the latest release, SBOM CI gate, and full regression coverage for all previously
untested `pg_extern` functions. v0.84.0 through v0.86.0 address all 82 findings
from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_13: v0.84.0 closes the ten "must-fix before v1.0.0"
items — HTTP companion readiness check, SECURITY
DEFINER inline justification, CI format-check gate, migration-chain checkpoints for
v0.80–v0.83, `gucs/registration.rs` split, `/health/ready`
deep-check, plan cache double-parse elimination, and `justfile` automation recipes;
v0.85.0 delivers correctness and code-quality improvements — `strict_dictionary` in
`batch_decode`, `schema.rs` and `federation.rs` module splits, CI module-size lint
gate, `describe_cbd` depth GUC, per-predicate merge fence lock, and a VP-promotion
crash-recovery regression test; v0.86.0 closes the remaining 30+ backlog items across
test coverage (proptest vs reference evaluator, fuzz targets, conformance trends CSV),
API polish (PT-code error registry, deprecated GUCs doc, OpenAPI YAML commit), supply
chain (dependency upgrades, SBOM gate, toolchain update), observability (post-optimiser
EXPLAIN field, JSON log mode, graceful shutdown), standards conformance (SPARQL 1.2
tracking, GeoSPARQL inventory, DESCRIBE algorithm doc), and HTTP companion security
(Arrow info leak, docker-compose random password, bulk-loader path canonicalization).
v0.87.0 delivers the uncertain knowledge engine:
probabilistic Datalog with `@weight(FLOAT)` rule annotations and noisy-OR multi-path
confidence combination; `pg:confidence()` SPARQL function and
`load_triples_with_confidence()` bulk-loader; fuzzy SPARQL filters
(`pg:fuzzy_match()`, `pg:token_set_ratio()`, and confidence-threshold
`pg:confPath()` property-path queries); soft SHACL scoring via
`pg_ripple.shacl_score()`; and provenance-weighted confidence derived
automatically from PROV-O source trust metadata via Datalog rules.
v0.88.0 delivers Datalog-native PageRank and a comprehensive graph analytics layer:
iterative PageRank computed entirely inside pg_ripple's Datalog engine using
aggregation, tabling, and convergence-aware early termination; `pg:pagerank()` and
`pg:pagerank(?node, ?topic)` SPARQL functions; personalized PageRank with
predicate-scoped bias; `pg_ripple.pagerank_run()` with damping factor, iteration cap,
convergence threshold, direction, edge-weight predicate, topic, temporal decay, and
seed parameters; a materialized `pagerank_scores` view with `topic`, `score_lower`,
`score_upper`, `stale`, and `stale_since` columns; a **pg-trickle incremental
refresh path** (K-hop Z-set local push, score-bounds propagation, selective
recomputation, IVM queue metrics); confidence-weighted edges integrating with
v0.87.0's uncertain knowledge engine; topic-sensitive multi-run scoring;
reverse/in-degree ranking for hub-and-authority decomposition; temporal edge-weight
decay; SHACL constraint-aware ranking via `sh:importance`, `sh:excludeFromRanking`,
and `shacl_score()` quality threshold; sketch-based `pg:topN_approx()` for
sub-millisecond approximate top-K; score explanation trees via
`pg_ripple.explain_pagerank()`; graph-partitioned parallel computation;
standard-format export (Turtle/JSON-LD/CSV/N-Triples); federation blend mode with
confidence-gated remote edge filtering (PR-FED-CONF-01); four alternative centrality
measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, Katz) via `pg:centrality()` and
`pg_ripple.centrality_run()`; and six cross-version synergies that deepen the
v0.87.0 integration: confidence-attenuated K-hop propagation (PR-TRICKLE-CONF-01),
probabilistic PageRank rules via `@weight` Datalog annotations (PR-PROB-DATALOG-01),
centrality-guided entity deduplication combining betweenness + `pg:fuzzy_match()`
(PR-ENTITY-RESOLUTION-01), source-trust-weighted eigenvector centrality seeded by
`pg:sourceTrust` values (PR-TRUST-EIGEN-01), confidence-gated federation edges
(PR-FED-CONF-01), and temporal authority detection via Katz centrality with
time-aware edge weights (PR-KATZ-TEMPORAL-01); PT0401–PT0423 error catalog.
v0.89.0 through v0.92.0 address all 97 findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_14:
v0.89.0 closes the seven High findings and the five Must-fix pre-v1.0.0 backlog items
— deleting the stale `src/gucs/registration.rs.bak` backup file (72 KB, bypassing the
file-size CI lint), adding migration-chain checkpoints for v0.84–v0.88 with a
structural version-sync assertion that eliminates the recurrence class, bumping
`COMPATIBLE_EXTENSION_MIN` to v0.88.0 and implementing `just bump-version X.Y.Z`
to make every future bump atomic, adding a confidence noisy-OR proptest vs a reference
oracle, hardening mutating PageRank HTTP handlers to require write-level auth,
auditing v0.87/v0.88 GUC names before the API freeze, and adding `fuzzy_max_input_length`
/ `pagerank_max_seeds` guards plus IRI escaping in `export_pagerank()`; v0.90.0 sweeps
the Medium correctness, performance, concurrency, and code-quality findings — PageRank
convergence-norm GUC, K-hop drift bound documentation, SPARQL MINUS blank-scope
regression test, export-format enum validation, WCOJ integration for large-graph
PageRank (10M+ edges), `clippy::unwrap_used` workspace lint gate, streaming VP scans
to avoid 4–8 GB temp materialisation on 100M-edge graphs, seven pre-emptive module
splits before the 1,800-line CI gate is tripped, `src/pagerank/` and `src/uncertain/`
submodule restructuring, probabilistic `@weight` parser validation, and cyclic
convergence documentation; v0.91.0 addresses the remaining Medium observability, API,
standards, build, and documentation findings — PageRank IVM Prometheus gauges,
SHACL score-log retention GUC, SSE endpoint verification, HTTP routing middleware
extraction, Arrow Flight row-count estimation improvement, `explain_pagerank_json()`
JSONB variant, PT error code registry completeness (PT0301–PT0423), SPARQL 1.2
tracking page update, RDF-star compliance matrix, dedicated `migration-chain.yml`
CI workflow, and compatibility matrix rows for v0.87/v0.88; v0.92.0 polishes all
39 Low-severity findings — bounds source comments, damping tuning guide, SERVICE
SILENT TLS test, RLS on `pagerank_dirty_edges`, `fuzzy_match` IMMUTABLE annotation,
`pagerank_partition` auto-tune, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` reproducible builds, and
WC-01–WC-05 post-v1.0.0 aspirational tracking issues filed for the v1.1.0–v1.2.0 arc.
v0.93.0 integrates the new `pg_tide` standalone extension (extracted from pg-trickle
v0.46.0), updating all relay/outbox/inbox call sites, rewriting the relay operations
doc to the `tide.*` API, and extending the compatibility matrix with `pg_tide ≥ 0.1.0`
rows. v0.94.0 through v0.97.0 address all 41 findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_15:
v0.94.0 closes the five High findings — the perennially recurring
`COMPATIBLE_EXTENSION_MIN` lag is finally eliminated structurally with a `just
bump-version X.Y.Z` recipe that atomically updates all seven version tokens; the lone
SECURITY DEFINER function gains the `SET search_path` clause required before the
third-party audit; the bidirectional relay gains a bounded channel with an explicit
drop-oldest overflow policy; and the bulk loader migrates to `COPY ... FROM STDIN
BINARY` with a shared `copy_into_vp()` helper used by all three high-volume insert
paths (bulk loader, R2RML, CDC); v0.95.0 sweeps Medium correctness and security
findings — DNS rebinding in the SSRF federation check, `DROP EXTENSION` replication-slot
cleanup, SSE error leakage, dictionary VACUUM scheduling, NaN/Inf confidence input
validation, plan cache schema-generation key, and `ADD`/`COPY`/`MOVE` SPARQL Update
pipeline integration; v0.96.0 addresses Medium performance, code-quality, and test-
coverage findings — HTAP tombstone-skip optimisation, star-pattern self-join collapse,
federation timeout separation, five large `mod.rs` sub-splits, `datalog_handlers.rs`
sub-split, missing-docs CI gate, four new Prometheus metrics, concurrent PageRank+writes
load test, and Arrow Flight EXPLAIN-based row estimate; v0.97.0 polishes all Low items
— CHANGELOG date fix, missing examples, `unsafe`/SAFETY 1:1 enforcement, `#[allow(...)]`
justification convention, `gen_random_uuid` availability check at `_PG_init`, serde_cbor
consumer upgrade, RDF-star position matrix, `cargo doc` CI gate, auto-computed migration
chain checkpoint, sequence exhaustion docs, `owl:sameAs` cycle regression test, and
conformance-suite pass-rate badges.
v1.0.0 is the stable release: a 72-hour continuous load test, a
third-party security audit, an API stability matrix for every `#[pg_extern]` and GUC,
documentation final audit and freeze, and public BSBM/WatDiv benchmark results.
v0.121.0 through v0.123.0 address all findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_17:
v0.121.0 is the security hardening release — it closes the H17-01 SSRF bypass in
`subscribe_rule_library()` (replacing string-contains with the battle-tested
`resolve_and_check_endpoint()` function), hardens the SSRF blocklist with CGNAT,
multicast, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 ranges (SEC-M-03), surfaces silently-swallowed SPI
errors across maintenance_api, kge, llm, and datalog/magic (BUG-M-01/02/03/04),
fixes the null-pointer UB in the GUC observability callback (BUG-L-01), and wires
mutation-journal entries for rule-library publish/subscribe operations (OBS-L-01);
v0.122.0 eliminates all eight remaining god modules over 1,000 lines (H17-02) —
decomposing sparql/expr/functions.rs, bulk_load.rs, storage/ops/scan.rs,
admin_handlers.rs, llm/mod.rs, datalog/compiler/mod.rs, gucs/registration/storage.rs,
and datalog/parser.rs into focused sub-modules — and closes all pg_regress test gaps
for v0.119.0–v0.120.0 features including rule-library federation, diagnostic-snapshot,
read-replica routing, compat_check(), and WatDiv correctness gating; v0.123.0 delivers
observability completeness (replica-pool Prometheus gauges, rule-library stream metrics),
full documentation for all v0.118–v0.120 features (rule-library guide, read-replica
ops doc, SQL API reference, compatibility matrix rows), four new blog posts, and
advisory management (RSA RUSTSEC Q3-2026 re-audit schedule, paste advisory verification).
v0.124.0 through v0.126.0 ship the three highest-priority new features identified in
Assessment 17: v0.124.0 executes SPARQL 1.2 property path algebra extensions (bidirectional
inverse, zero-or-one quantifier, negated property sets) that the parser has been accepting
since `features = ["sparql-12", "sep-0006"]` was enabled — converting a parser-only
feature into a fully-tested execution path with twenty pg_regress tests; v0.125.0 adds
temporal graph snapshots enabling point-in-time named-graph materialisation, time-travel
SPARQL queries, and a `graph_diff()` delta export TABLE — delivering immutable audit history
and compliance workflows on top of the Allen's interval relation engine from v0.118.0;
v0.126.0 adds per-endpoint federation credentials with OAuth2 Bearer and API-key support,
stored via pgcrypto encryption, injected at query time into reqwest federation calls —
making pg_ripple the first PostgreSQL-native RDF store with cryptographically protected
federation credential management.
v1.1.0 delivers post-stable improvements: Cypher/GQL transpiler (read-only and write
operations), Jupyter SPARQL kernel, LangChain/LlamaIndex tool packages, Kafka CDC sink,
materialized SPARQL views, a dbt adapter, a SPARQL endpoint FDW, pgai in-database
embedding generation, logical replication for pg_ripple knowledge graphs, the true
`COPY FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT binary)` bulk load path (FEAT-04) delivering another 2–3×
throughput improvement over the UNNEST-array path, and SPARQL federation mTLS/JWKS
enterprise authentication (FEAT-07). v1.2.0 delivers the Custom IndexAM for triple
patterns (WC-01) — a native PostgreSQL index access method that understands `(s, p, o, g)`
quad patterns for parallel index-only BGP scans — declarative VP table partitioning by
named graph (WC-03) for large multi-tenant deployments, and the Knowledge Graph Diff/Delta
Export API (FEAT-09) for event-sourcing and audit-compliance consumers. v1.3.0 delivers
OWL 2 EL profile reasoning with full normative rule tables targeting biomedical ontologies
(SNOMED CT, Gene Ontology, NCIt) and OWL 2 QL profile for large-ABox tractable reasoning
(FEAT-05), Parquet columnar cold-tier storage via DuckDB FDW for 5–20× analytical SPARQL
speedup on billion-triple graphs (FEAT-06), and Graph Neural Network integration
bridging PyG/DGL models into in-database GNN training and link prediction (FEAT-08).
