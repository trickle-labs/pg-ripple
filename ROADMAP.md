```

v0.1.0 through v0.5.1 build the complete core storage and query engine.
v0.6.0 through v0.10.0 add the HTAP architecture, SHACL validation, and the full
Datalog reasoning engine. v0.11.0 through v0.20.0 complete the SPARQL query and
update surfaces and establish the W3C conformance baseline. v0.21.0 through v0.32.0
harden correctness and deliver production-grade Datalog optimizations including
magic sets, semi-naive evaluation, well-founded semantics, and entity resolution.
v0.33.0 through v0.46.0 deliver the documentation site, parallel evaluation,
worst-case optimal joins, full conformance suites, and the AI/LLM integration layer.
v0.47.0 through v0.51.0 complete the architecture refactor and shipping hardening
required for a production release. v0.52.0 through v0.54.0 deliver the pg-trickle
relay integration and high-availability story. v0.55.0 through v0.56.0 address all
open security findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_6 (SSRF allowlist, error-catalog
drift) and add GeoSPARQL 1.1, federation circuit breaker, and the SPARQL audit log.
v0.57.0 through v0.59.0 extend the reasoning platform to OWL 2 EL/QL, add KG
embeddings, entity alignment, temporal RDF queries, Citus sharding with shard-pruning,
and PROV-O provenance. v0.60.0 through v0.62.0 are the pre-1.0 hardening and
ecosystem sprint: v0.60.0 closes the remaining v1.0.0 blockers identified in
PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_7 (HTAP atomic swap, CI supply-chain hardening, fuzz target
gaps, `geof:distance`); v0.61.0 delivers ecosystem depth (per-graph RLS, inference
explainability, GDPR erasure, dbt adapter, SHACL-AF execution, richer federation call stats);
v0.62.0 delivers the query frontier (Arrow Flight bulk export, WCOJ planner
integration, visual graph explorer) plus six Citus scalability improvements (property-path
push-down, `vp_rare` cold-entry archival, tiered dictionary cache, distributed inference
dispatch, live shard rebalance, multi-hop pruning carry-forward). v0.63.0 introduces
SPARQL CONSTRUCT writeback rules: any CONSTRUCT query can be registered as a persistent
rule that writes its derived triples directly into a target named graph inside the VP
storage layer and maintains them incrementally — inserts trigger a delta derivation path,
deletes trigger Delete-Rederive retraction — enabling raw-to-canonical model pipelines
where the canonical graph is always consistent with the latest raw data.
v0.63.0 also delivers eight Citus scalability improvements (CITUS-30–37): SERVICE
result shard pruning, streaming coordinator fan-out via SPARQL cursor, approximate
`COUNT(DISTINCT)` via HyperLogLog, batched dictionary encoding, per-worker statement-ID
local tables, non-blocking VP promotion via shadow-table pattern, per-graph RLS
propagation CI gate, and per-worker BRIN summarise after merge. v0.64.0 through
v0.64.0 through
v0.69.0 convert the findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_8 and PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_9 into explicit
roadmap work: v0.64.0 adds the truth-in-release guardrails (feature status,
deep readiness, immutable CI actions, release digest scanning, and documentation
correction); v0.65.0 closes CONSTRUCT writeback correctness (delta maintenance,
HTAP-aware retraction, exact provenance, and the full behavior test matrix);
v0.66.0 makes the streaming and distributed claims real or explicitly labels
them as planner hints/stubs/helpers (true SPARQL cursors, signed Arrow IPC export,
explainable WCOJ mode, and integrated Citus pruning/HLL/BRIN/RLS/promotion paths);
v0.67.0 addresses all four Critical findings from Assessment 9 (storage mutation
journal closing all CONSTRUCT writeback bypass paths, VP table RLS coverage,
Arrow Flight ticket security and tombstone-aware export, fail-closed release-truth
scripts) and gathers production evidence (soak tests, audit or threat-model closure,
public benchmarks, upgrade/backup acceptance, and mandatory release evidence
artifacts); v0.68.0 completes the distributed execution and streaming contracts
that were labelled partial or planned in v0.62–v0.66 (true CONSTRUCT streaming,
Citus HLL aggregate translation, Citus SERVICE pruning, nonblocking VP promotion,
and scheduled fuzz CI for all twelve targets); and v0.69.0 restructures the large
source modules along single-responsibility boundaries to make the codebase
maintainable for a v1.0.0 API freeze.
v0.70.0 through v0.73.0 address the findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_10:
v0.70.0 closes all four Critical findings (bulk-load mutation journal bypass,
per-triple flush overhead, missing evidence file citations, SHACL-SPARQL docs)
and six High/Medium items (README stale, RLS DDL quoting, SBOM currency, missing
test files, legacy script cleanup, roadmap status correction); v0.71.0 validates
the Arrow Flight streaming contract with an RSS-bounded 10 M-row integration test,
implements the previously-missing Citus RLS propagation integration test, adds an
extension/HTTP companion compatibility matrix, and documents HLL accuracy bounds;
v0.72.0 hardens the mutation journal against PostgreSQL SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK via
xact callbacks, continues the v0.69.0 module split for the three largest remaining
files, adds a ConstructTemplate proptest suite and a SPARQL Update fuzz target,
promotes W3C conformance and BSBM gates to required CI, adds Arrow Flight replay
protection, and tests the Datalog→CWB interaction chain; v0.73.0 tracks SPARQL 1.2,
delivers a live SPARQL subscription API prototype via SSE, and completes the
ecosystem hardening items (CONTRIBUTING.md, Helm chart SHA pinning, feature status
taxonomy, and R2RML scope documentation).
v0.74.0 through v0.76.0 address Assessment 11 findings: evidence-path truthfulness
(twelve doc stubs, CI gate fix), mutation journal wiring for Datalog/R2RML/CDC,
HTTP companion version alignment, unwrap/panic audit, URL parser fuzz target, RLS
hash widening, Rust toolchain pin, and benchmark baseline refresh. v0.77.0 and
v0.78.0 deliver bidirectional RDF integration: source attribution, conflict
resolution, linkback, outbox/inbox transport, per-subscription side-band auth,
write-time redaction, audit trail, and the non-blocking draft RDF Bidirectional
Integration Profile v1. v0.79.0 closes the last two known query-engine limitations
— true Leapfrog Triejoin executor (WCOJ) and full `sh:SPARQLRule` evaluation — so
every `feature_status()` row reads `implemented`. v0.80.0 through v0.83.0 address
all findings from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_12: critical SQL injection and SSRF
security hardening, property-path cycle detection, SPARQL Update and Datalog
mutation journal wiring, HTAP merge SID determinism, federation URL/truncation
correctness, plan cache GUC completeness, migration chain test assertions through
the latest release, SBOM CI gate, and full regression coverage for all previously
untested `pg_extern` functions. v0.84.0 through v0.86.0 address all 82 findings
from PLAN_OVERALL_ASSESSMENT_13: v0.84.0 closes the ten "must-fix before v1.0.0"
items — HTTP companion readiness check, SECURITY
DEFINER inline justification, CI format-check gate, migration-chain checkpoints for
v0.80–v0.83, `gucs/registration.rs` split, `/health/ready`
deep-check, plan cache double-parse elimination, and `justfile` automation recipes;
v0.85.0 delivers correctness and code-quality improvements — `strict_dictionary` in
`batch_decode`, `schema.rs` and `federation.rs` module splits, CI module-size lint
gate, `describe_cbd` depth GUC, per-predicate merge fence lock, and a VP-promotion
crash-recovery regression test; v0.86.0 closes the remaining 30+ backlog items across
test coverage (proptest vs reference evaluator, fuzz targets, conformance trends CSV),
API polish (PT-code error registry, deprecated GUCs doc, OpenAPI YAML commit), supply
chain (dependency upgrades, SBOM gate, toolchain update), observability (post-optimiser
EXPLAIN field, JSON log mode, graceful shutdown), standards conformance (SPARQL 1.2
tracking, GeoSPARQL inventory, DESCRIBE algorithm doc), and HTTP companion security
(Arrow info leak, docker-compose random password, bulk-loader path canonicalization).
v0.87.0 delivers the uncertain knowledge engine:
probabilistic Datalog with `@weight(FLOAT)` rule annotations and noisy-OR multi-path
confidence combination; `pg:confidence()` SPARQL function and
`load_triples_with_confidence()` bulk-loader; fuzzy SPARQL filters
(`pg:fuzzy_match()`, `pg:token_set_ratio()`, and confidence-threshold
`pg:confPath()` property-path queries); soft SHACL scoring via
`pg_ripple.shacl_score()`; and provenance-weighted confidence derived
automatically from PROV-O source trust metadata via Datalog rules.
v0.88.0 delivers Datalog-native PageRank and a comprehensive graph analytics layer:
iterative PageRank computed entirely inside pg_ripple's Datalog engine using
aggregation, tabling, and convergence-aware early termination; `pg:pagerank()` and
`pg:pagerank(?node, ?topic)` SPARQL functions; personalized PageRank with
predicate-scoped bias; `pg_ripple.pagerank_run()` with damping factor, iteration cap,
convergence threshold, direction, edge-weight predicate, topic, temporal decay, and
seed parameters; a materialized `pagerank_scores` view with `topic`, `score_lower`,
`score_upper`, `stale`, and `stale_since` columns; a **pg-trickle incremental
refresh path** (K-hop Z-set local push, score-bounds propagation, selective
recomputation, IVM queue metrics); confidence-weighted edges integrating with
v0.87.0's uncertain knowledge engine; topic-sensitive multi-run scoring;
reverse/in-degree ranking for hub-and-authority decomposition; temporal edge-weight
decay; SHACL constraint-aware ranking via `sh:importance`, `sh:excludeFromRanking`,
and `shacl_score()` quality threshold; sketch-based `pg:topN_approx()` for
sub-millisecond approximate top-K; score explanation trees via
`pg_ripple.explain_pagerank()`; graph-partitioned parallel computation;
standard-format export (Turtle/JSON-LD/CSV/N-Triples); federation blend mode with
confidence-gated remote edge filtering (PR-FED-CONF-01); four alternative centrality
measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, Katz) via `pg:centrality()` and
`pg_ripple.centrality_run()`; and six cross-version synergies that deepen the
v0.87.0 integration: confidence-attenuated K-hop propagation (PR-TRICKLE-CONF-01),
probabilistic PageRank rules via `@weight` Datalog annotations (PR-PROB-DATALOG-01),
centrality-guided entity deduplication combining betweenness + `pg:fuzzy_match()`
(PR-ENTITY-RESOLUTION-01), source-trust-weighted eigenvector centrality seeded by
`pg:sourceTrust` values (PR-TRUST-EIGEN-01), confidence-gated federation edges
(PR-FED-CONF-01), and temporal authority detection via Katz centrality with
time-aware edge weights (PR-KATZ-TEMPORAL-01); PT0401–PT0423 error catalog.
v1.0.0 is the stable release: a 72-hour continuous load test, a
third-party security audit, documentation final audit and freeze, an API stability
guarantee, and public BSBM/WatDiv benchmark results. v1.1.0 delivers
post-stable improvements: Cypher/GQL transpiler (read-only and write operations),
Jupyter SPARQL kernel, LangChain/LlamaIndex tool packages, Kafka CDC sink,
materialized SPARQL views, and a dbt adapter.
