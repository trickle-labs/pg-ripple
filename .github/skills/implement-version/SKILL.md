# Implement pg_ripple Roadmap Version

## Autonomous Execution Contract

This skill runs **end-to-end without pausing for approval** unless a genuine decision blocker is hit (see "When to pause" below). The agent:

- Commits and pushes code without asking first
- Runs fmt/clippy/test and self-heals failures before each commit
- Monitors CI after each push and loads the `fix-ci` skill to resolve failures autonomously
- Only stops when CI is green and all exit criteria are met

**When to pause (genuine blockers only):**
- An architectural trade-off with no clear answer in ROADMAP.md or implementation_plan.md
- A failing test that is caused by an ambiguity in the spec (not a bug)
- A destructive migration (DROP TABLE, breaking API change) that was not in the spec

Everything else — compiler errors, clippy warnings, test failures, CI failures — is resolved autonomously. Do not ask for permission to fix these.

**Pre-existing test failures must also be fixed.** If a test was already failing before the current changes, fix it anyway. Do not skip or ignore failures on the grounds that "I didn't break this". The codebase must be in a fully green state before tagging any version.

## Authoritative Sources

Always read these before writing any code:

- [ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md) — deliverables, exit criteria, test file names, effort estimates, version prerequisites
- [plans/implementation_plan.md](../../../plans/implementation_plan.md) — schemas, API signatures, algorithms, crate choices, GUC parameters, §14 documentation conventions
- [plans/documentation.md](../../../plans/documentation.md) — docs site structure, tooling, and the full milestone-by-milestone list of pages to create or update
- [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) — code conventions, build/test commands, git workflow

## Procedure

### 1. Read the version section in ROADMAP.md

Locate the target version. Read its full section — deliverables checklist, plain-language explanation, notes, and exit criteria.

### 2. Cross-reference implementation_plan.md

For each deliverable, look up the corresponding section in the implementation plan for exact schemas, function signatures, and algorithm details. The plan is authoritative when ROADMAP.md and the plan disagree.

### 3. Audit existing code

```bash
ls -la src/
grep -rn "pg_extern" src/ --include="*.rs"
cargo pgrx test pg18 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Understand what already exists before adding anything.

### 4. Implement deliverables in order

Items in the ROADMAP.md checklist are listed in dependency order — implement them top to bottom. For each deliverable:

1. Write the Rust implementation
2. Add SQL to `sql/` if needed
3. Write `#[pg_test]` integration tests
4. Write the pg_regress `.sql` file
5. **Tick the checkbox in ROADMAP.md** — change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for that deliverable immediately after it is implemented and tested; do not batch this at the end

### 5. Self-healing pre-commit loop

**Run this before every `git commit` and fix all failures before committing:**

```bash
# Step A: format (auto-fix)
cargo fmt --all

# Step B: lint (auto-fix then verify)
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --features pg18
cargo clippy --features pg18 -- -D warnings        # must be zero warnings

# Step C: unit + integration tests
cargo pgrx test pg18                               # must be zero failures

# Step D: pg_regress
cargo pgrx regress pg18 --postgresql-conf "allow_system_table_mods=on"
```

If Step B emits warnings after `--fix`, fix them manually — common patterns:
- `#![allow(dead_code)]` for WIP modules not yet called from `pg_extern`
- `std::slice::from_ref(x)` instead of `&[x.clone()]`
- Let-chains (`if let ... && condition`) instead of nested if-let

If Step C or D fails, fix the root cause before committing — do **not** suppress test failures with `#[ignore]` or `should_panic` unless that is the correct semantic.

### 6. Commit and push discipline

Group related changes into logical commits. Commit message style: lowercase first word, imperative mood, no trailing period. Push immediately after each commit:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
git push origin main
```

### 7. Monitor CI and self-heal

After pushing, check CI status with:

```bash
gh run list --limit 3
```

If CI fails, **immediately load the `fix-ci` skill** and resolve the failure autonomously. Do not pause and ask the user. Common CI-specific failures not caught locally:

- Linux linker errors (GNU ld vs. lld flag differences)
- Missing apt-get dependencies in the CI runner
- pg_regress expected output mismatches due to platform differences

When CI is green on the pushed commit, continue to the next deliverable.

### 8. Verify exit criteria

Before closing a version, check every exit criterion in ROADMAP.md explicitly. Do not mark a version done on partial evidence.

### 9. Write documentation

Every ROADMAP.md version section contains a `### Documentation` subsection. Treat those checkboxes exactly like code deliverables.

1. Read the `### Documentation` subsection for the target version in ROADMAP.md.
2. Cross-reference [plans/documentation.md](../../../plans/documentation.md) for the full page specification (content, structure, examples required).
3. Create or expand each listed `docs/src/` page.
4. Verify the page is wired into `docs/src/SUMMARY.md`.
5. Run `mdbook build docs` locally to confirm the site builds without errors.
6. **Tick each documentation checkbox in ROADMAP.md** — same discipline as code checkboxes.

### 10. Wrap the released section in ROADMAP.md

After tagging a version, wrap its full `## v0.X.Y` section in a `<details>` block so the roadmap stays readable as completed releases accumulate. This is the same convention used in pg_trickle.

The wrapping rule:
- **Keep outside `<details>`**: the `## v0.X.Y — Title` heading, the `**Theme**:` line, and the `> **In plain language:**` blockquote (including any nested notes and the effort estimate).
- **Wrap inside `<details>`**: everything from the first `### ` sub-heading (usually `### Prerequisites` or `### Deliverables`) through to the line just before the `---` section separator.

Template:

```markdown
## v0.X.Y — Title

**Theme**: brief theme.

> **In plain language:** ...
>
> **Effort estimate: N–M person-weeks**

<details>
<summary>Completed items (click to expand)</summary>

### Deliverables

- [x] ...

### Exit Criteria

...

</details>

---
```

**After tagging, apply the wrapper** — add the four lines (`<details>`, `<summary>…</summary>`, blank line, and the matching `</details>` + blank line before `---`) to the just-released section in ROADMAP.md, commit with message `"docs: wrap v0.X.Y section in details"`, and push.

## Common Pitfalls

These are the mistakes most likely to produce silent bugs:

- **String comparisons in VP tables are a bug** — always encode to `i64` first; the integer-join invariant is load-bearing
- **Encode FILTER constants at translation time** — never at execution time
- **Batch decode query results** — collect all output IDs, decode with `WHERE id = ANY(...)`, then emit rows; never decode per-row
- **Document-scope blank nodes** — use `load_generation` prefix; `_:b0` from two different loads must get different IDs
- **ANALYZE after bulk loads** — planner statistics must be current for generated SQL join plans to be correct
- **Table names via OID lookup** — look up `table_oid` from `_pg_ripple.predicates`; never concatenate raw predicate IDs into SQL strings
- **CYCLE clause for property paths** — use PG18's `CYCLE` clause, not array-based visited tracking

## Implementation Checklist Template

```markdown
## vX.Y.Z Implementation Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] All prior version tests pass: `cargo pgrx test pg18`
- [ ] Any blocking prerequisites resolved (check ROADMAP.md version section)
- [ ] New crate dependencies pinned in Cargo.toml

### Deliverables
(copy checklist items verbatim from ROADMAP.md, add test item for each)

### Testing

### Exit Criteria
(copy exit criteria verbatim from ROADMAP.md, check each explicitly)

### Pre-Release
- [ ] **Extension migration script created** — **CRITICAL** (see [Extension Versioning & Migration Scripts](../../../AGENTS.md#extension-versioning--migration-scripts))
  - File: `sql/pg_ripple--X.(Y-1).Z--X.Y.Z.sql`
  - Include schema changes (ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, etc.) if any exist
  - Otherwise, write a comment header explaining what functionality is new
  - Without this file, users on earlier versions cannot upgrade via `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE`

  - All listed `docs/src/` pages created or expanded
  - All documentation checkboxes in ROADMAP.md ticked (`- [x]`)
  - `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` updated to include any new pages
  - `mdbook build docs` passes without errors
- [ ] Verify `Cargo.toml` version field matches X.Y.Z
- [ ] Verify `pg_ripple.control` `default_version` matches X.Y.Z

### Git
- [ ] All ROADMAP.md deliverable checkboxes for this version are ticked (`- [x]`)
- [ ] Released ROADMAP.md section wrapped in `<details>` (see step 10 in the Procedure above)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] All commits pushed to `origin/main`
- [ ] CI is green on the latest pushed commit (`gh run list --limit 1`)

## Completion Report

When the implementation checklist is complete and all tests pass, generate a completion report that includes:

### Report Structure

1. **Version Summary**
   - Version number and delivery name
   - List of completed deliverables (major features only, not every checkbox)
   - Lines of code added (via `git diff`)

2. **Remaining Work**
   - **Blockedby next version** — List any deliverables in the next ROADMAP.md version that depend on this version, to clarify the critical path
   - **Deferred items** — Any items from the original ROADMAP.md spec that were descoped or moved to a future version, with brief justification
   - **Outstanding PRs or issues** — Any related GitHub issues or PRs that are still open and non-blocking
   - **Technical debt** — Any known limitations, TODOs in code, or performance concerns that should be addressed in the next version

3. **Next Steps for the Next Version**
   - Prerequisites to unblock (e.g., "SPARQL optimizer should be moved to v0.5 to allow v0.6 property-paths to land")
   - Suggested focus areas for the next milestone
   - Links to relevant ROADMAP.md section and implementation_plan.md sections

### How to Generate the Report

1. **Completed deliverables**: Extract from ROADMAP.md for this version; count `[x]` checkboxes in code and documentation sections.
2. **Next version blockers**: Read ROADMAP.md section for next version; identify deliverables with explicit prerequisites (e.g., "requires v0.4 storage layer").
3. **Deferred items**: Search ROADMAP.md and git commit history for items marked "descoped for vX.Y.Z" or similar; include reason.
4. **Outstanding items**: Run `gh issue list -R trickle-labs/pg-ripple --label "defer" --label "backlog"` and `gh pr list -R trickle-labs/pg-ripple --draft` to find open items.
5. **Code TODOs**: Run `grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" src/ --include="*.rs" | head -20` to surface code-level concerns.
6. **Git stats**: Run `git log vX.(Y-1).Z..HEAD --oneline | wc -l` and `git diff vX.(Y-1).Z HEAD --stat --summary | tail -3` for diff stats.

**Generate this report at version completion as a summary message to the user.** It provides visibility into progress, highlights what depends on this version, and frames the next milestone clearly.
