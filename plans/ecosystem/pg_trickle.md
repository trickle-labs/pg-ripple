# pg_trickle Integration Analysis for pg_ripple

## 1. What Is pg_trickle?

[pg_trickle](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-trickle) is a PostgreSQL 18 extension (Rust/pgrx 0.17) that provides **declarative, automatically-refreshing materialized views** — called *stream tables* — powered by Incremental View Maintenance (IVM). When a base table changes, pg_trickle computes only the delta (changed rows), not the full result set. It supports the full SQL surface: JOINs, aggregates, window functions, CTEs (including `WITH RECURSIVE`), subqueries, LATERAL, and TopK.

Key capabilities relevant to pg_ripple:

- **Incremental View Maintenance**: Only changed rows are processed (5–90× faster than full recomputation at 1% change rate)
- **DAG-aware scheduling**: Stream tables can depend on other stream tables; refreshed in topological order
- **Trigger-based and WAL-based CDC**: Hybrid change data capture with automatic mode selection
- **IMMEDIATE mode**: In-transaction IVM — stream table updated within the same transaction as the DML
- **Full SQL coverage**: GROUP BY, JOIN, WINDOW, WITH RECURSIVE, EXISTS, LATERAL, all expression types
- **Same tech stack**: PostgreSQL 18, Rust, pgrx 0.17 — identical to pg_ripple

## 2. Integration Opportunities

### 2.1 Extended Vertical Partitioning (ExtVP) via Stream Tables

**Problem**: The deep-dive report identifies Extended Vertical Partitioning (ExtVP) as a critical optimization for world-class performance. ExtVP pre-computes semi-joins between frequently co-joined predicate tables. Our implementation plan defers ExtVP to post-1.0.

**pg_trickle solution**: Stream tables are a perfect implementation mechanism for ExtVP materialized views.

```sql
-- Pre-computed semi-join: subjects that have both foaf:knows AND foaf:name
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.extvp_knows_name_ss',
    query => $$
        SELECT k.s, k.o AS knows_obj
        FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7 k  -- foaf:knows
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM _pg_ripple.vp_12 n  -- foaf:name
            WHERE n.s = k.s
        )
    $$,
    schedule => '10s'
);
```

**Benefits**:
- ExtVP views stay incrementally up-to-date as triples are inserted/deleted — no manual refresh
- pg_trickle's EXISTS/semi-join delta operators handle the maintenance efficiently
- The SPARQL→SQL translator can rewrite queries to target these stream tables instead of raw VP tables
- pg_trickle's DAG awareness ensures ExtVP views refresh after their source VP tables

**Impact**: Brings ExtVP from "post-1.0" to achievable within the 0.x roadmap without building custom materialized view infrastructure.

### 2.2 Incremental SPARQL Views (Live SPARQL Results)

**Problem**: Frequently-executed SPARQL queries — dashboard queries, API-backing queries, materialized reasoning steps — re-execute the full multi-join SQL each time, including dictionary decoding. As the graph grows the latency grows with it.

**pg_trickle solution**: Compile a SPARQL SELECT query into a pg_trickle stream table. The query becomes an always-fresh, incrementally-maintained result set. Reading results is a simple table scan; pg_trickle's IVM engine handles incremental updates as triples are inserted or deleted.

#### Compilation pipeline

```
SPARQL SELECT query
    │
    ▼  (existing spargebra parser)
Algebra IR
    │
    ▼  (existing SQL generator — with named column aliases added)
SQL with SPARQL variables as column aliases (?person → AS person)
    │
    ▼
pgtrickle.create_stream_table(name, query, schedule / refresh_mode)
    │
    ▼
Stream table: always-fresh, incrementally maintained SPARQL result set
```

The SPARQL→SQL compiler is already the hard part. The only additional requirement is that the generated SQL emits **named column aliases** matching SPARQL variable names (`?person → AS person`, `?email → AS email`) so the stream table schema is readable.

#### Design decision: dictionary decode inside or outside the stream table?

**Option A — decode inside** (strings materialized, simplest read path):

```sql
-- Stream table stores decoded TEXT values
SELECT r1.value AS person, r2.value AS email
FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7 t          -- rdf:type
JOIN _pg_ripple.dictionary r1 ON r1.id = t.s
JOIN _pg_ripple.vp_15 e         -- foaf:mbox
  ON e.s = t.s
JOIN _pg_ripple.dictionary r2 ON r2.id = e.o
WHERE t.o = 42                  -- foaf:Person (integer-encoded)
```

Reading is `SELECT * FROM active_person_emails` — fully decoded, no joins. The downside: every `dictionary` insert (triggered by any new triple load) can wake up the CDC engine even when no relevant rows changed.

**Option B — decode outside** *(recommended)* (integers in stream table, thin view on top):

```sql
-- Stream table stores i64 IDs only — minimal CDC surface
SELECT t.s AS person_id, e.o AS email_id
FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7 t
JOIN _pg_ripple.vp_15 e ON e.s = t.s
WHERE t.o = 42
```

A companion decoding view sits on top and is exposed to users:

```sql
CREATE VIEW pg_ripple.active_person_emails AS
SELECT r1.value AS person, r2.value AS email
FROM _pg_ripple.sparql_view_active_person_emails v
JOIN _pg_ripple.dictionary r1 ON r1.id = v.person_id
JOIN _pg_ripple.dictionary r2 ON r2.id = v.email_id;
```

Option B is the better default: narrower CDC surface (only VP tables matter), smaller stream table (BIGINTs vs TEXT), dictionary decode still happens once per changed row rather than on every read.

#### Handling SPARQL language features

| SPARQL feature | SQL mapping | IVM notes |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT DISTINCT | `SELECT DISTINCT` | pg_trickle handles DISTINCT diff correctly |
| OPTIONAL | `LEFT JOIN` | Supported in IVM |
| FILTER | `WHERE` (pre-encoded constants) | Filter pushdown — no runtime encode |
| UNION | `UNION` | Supported |
| GROUP BY + aggregates | `GROUP BY` with COUNT/SUM/AVG | pg_trickle's strongest differential case |
| Property paths (`+`, `*`) | `WITH RECURSIVE … CYCLE` | pg_trickle supports recursive CTEs; transitive closure recomputed incrementally |
| VALUES | SQL `VALUES` | Treated as inline constant table |
| BIND | Column alias expression | Passthrough |

#### Refresh mode selection

| Query characteristics | Recommended mode | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Constraint / ASK-style monitoring | `IMMEDIATE` | Violation detected within same transaction |
| Dashboard queries, API results | `schedule => '1s'` with `DIFFERENTIAL` | Sub-second freshness, efficient delta |
| Heavy analytics (infrequent updates) | `schedule => '30s'` with `FULL` | Full recompute cheap when data is stable |
| Property path / transitive closure | `schedule => '30s'` | Transitive closure is bulk-compute; DIFFERENTIAL is less effective here |

#### Parameterized queries

SPARQL queries with runtime variable bindings cannot become stream tables directly (stream tables have no parameters). Two approaches:

- **Require fully-bound queries**: all FILTER constants and class restrictions must be statically known at creation time. This is the initial API surface.
- **Binding table pattern** (future): `WHERE t.o = (SELECT id FROM sparql_view_params WHERE view_name = 'active_people' AND param = 'type')` — indirection via a small parameters table that itself CDC-tracked.

#### Supported query forms (initial release)

`SELECT` queries only. `CONSTRUCT`, `DESCRIBE`, and `ASK` are deferred:
- `ASK` could map to a `BOOLEAN` stream table backed by `EXISTS(…)`, but adds schema complexity.
- `CONSTRUCT` / `DESCRIBE` return triples, not tabular results; stream tables are relational.

#### Catalog table

A new catalog table tracks all registered SPARQL views:

```sql
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.sparql_views (
    name          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sparql        TEXT NOT NULL,         -- original SPARQL text
    generated_sql TEXT NOT NULL,         -- SQL sent to pg_trickle
    schedule      TEXT NOT NULL,         -- e.g. '1s' or 'IMMEDIATE'
    decode        BOOLEAN NOT NULL,      -- TRUE = Option A, FALSE = Option B
    stream_table  TEXT NOT NULL,         -- fully qualified stream table name
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### API surface

```sql
-- Create a named, live-updating SPARQL result set
SELECT pg_ripple.create_sparql_view(
    name     => 'active_people',
    sparql   => $$
        SELECT ?person ?email WHERE {
            ?person a foaf:Person ;
                    foaf:mbox ?email .
        }
    $$,
    schedule => '1s',       -- or 'IMMEDIATE', '30s', etc.
    decode   => FALSE        -- FALSE (recommended): keep integer IDs in stream table
);

-- Results are always fresh — simple table scan, sub-millisecond
SELECT * FROM active_people WHERE email LIKE '%@example.org';

-- Drop when no longer needed
SELECT pg_ripple.drop_sparql_view('active_people');

-- List all registered SPARQL views
SELECT name, sparql, schedule, created_at
FROM pg_ripple.list_sparql_views();
```

Internally `create_sparql_view` runs:
1. Parse SPARQL → algebra IR
2. Encode all FILTER constants to `i64` (reuse existing dictionary encoder)
3. Generate SQL with named column aliases
4. Register entry in `_pg_ripple.sparql_views`
5. Call `pgtrickle.create_stream_table(name => …, query => …, schedule => …)`

**Benefits**:
- Converts multi-join SPARQL-generated SQL (VP table joins + dictionary decodes) into a simple table scan
- pg_trickle's differential mode processes only the triples that changed, not the full join
- Dictionary decoding happens once during materialization (Option A) or once per changed row (Option B), not on every query
- Particularly powerful for star queries and analytical dashboards
- Property path closures (expensive recursive CTEs) become pre-materialized — 5–20× faster at read time

### 2.3 HTAP Delta→Main Merge Replacement

**Problem**: Our implementation plan (v0.5.0) calls for building a custom background worker to merge delta partitions into main partitions — a non-trivial piece of infrastructure.

**pg_trickle alternative**: Model each VP table's "main" partition as a stream table over the delta.

```sql
-- The delta table is the source of truth (base table)
-- The main table is a stream table that mirrors it
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.vp_7_main',
    query => $$
        SELECT s, o, g FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7_delta
    $$,
    schedule     => '30s',
    refresh_mode => 'DIFFERENTIAL'
);
```

**Analysis**: This approach is elegant but has trade-offs:

| Aspect | Custom Merge Worker | pg_trickle Stream Table |
|---|---|---|
| Complexity | High (custom BGW, SPI, latch signaling) | Low (declarative) |
| BRIN index control | Full control over CLUSTER + BRIN rebuild | pg_trickle manages storage; no BRIN control |
| Compression | Can compress main partition | Stream tables are standard heap |
| Merge granularity | Batch size configurable | Driven by schedule |
| Read path | UNION ALL of delta + main | Query the stream table directly |

**Recommendation**: Use the custom merge worker for the core HTAP path (v0.5.0) where we need full control over storage layout, but use pg_trickle stream tables for *derived aggregates and analytics* built on top of the VP tables. The two approaches complement rather than replace each other.

### 2.4 Real-Time Analytics & Statistics

**Problem**: `pg_ripple.stats()` currently re-scans catalog tables on every call. Predicate distribution, triple counts, and graph sizes need to be fresh but shouldn't require full scans.

**pg_trickle solution**: Stream tables for live operational metrics.

```sql
-- Per-predicate triple count, always current
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.predicate_stats',
    query => $$
        SELECT p.id AS predicate_id,
               p.iri,
               COUNT(*) AS triple_count,
               COUNT(DISTINCT t.s) AS distinct_subjects,
               COUNT(DISTINCT t.o) AS distinct_objects
        FROM _pg_ripple.predicates p
        JOIN _pg_ripple.all_triples_view t ON t.p = p.id
        GROUP BY p.id, p.iri
    $$,
    schedule => '5s'
);

-- Graph-level statistics
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.graph_stats',
    query => $$
        SELECT g AS graph_id,
               r.value AS graph_iri,
               COUNT(*) AS triple_count
        FROM _pg_ripple.all_triples_view t
        JOIN _pg_ripple.dictionary r ON r.id = t.g
        GROUP BY g, r.value
    $$,
    schedule => '10s'
);
```

**Benefits**:
- `pg_ripple.stats()` becomes a simple `SELECT * FROM _pg_ripple.predicate_stats` — instant
- Aggregate maintenance is algebraic (COUNT/SUM) — pg_trickle's strongest differential case
- No custom counting infrastructure needed

### 2.5 SHACL Violation Monitoring

**Problem**: The implementation plan (v0.6.0–v0.7.0) designs an async validation pipeline with a custom background worker processing a validation queue.

**pg_trickle solution**: Model SHACL constraint checks as stream tables.

```sql
-- Cardinality violation detection: subjects missing a required property
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.shacl_violations_min_count',
    query => $$
        -- Subjects of type foaf:Person (pred 7 = rdf:type, obj 42 = foaf:Person)
        -- that are missing foaf:name (pred 12)
        SELECT t.s AS subject_id, 12 AS required_predicate
        FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7 t
        WHERE t.o = 42  -- foaf:Person
          AND NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 FROM _pg_ripple.vp_12 n WHERE n.s = t.s
          )
    $$,
    refresh_mode => 'IMMEDIATE'  -- validate in same transaction
);

-- Any row in this stream table = a SHACL violation
-- Empty table = all constraints satisfied
```

**Benefits**:
- `IMMEDIATE` mode validates within the same transaction — no async lag
- NOT EXISTS delta operators handle the semi-join efficiently
- Violation detection is declarative, not procedural
- Multiple SHACL shapes → multiple stream tables → pg_trickle's DAG handles ordering
- Violations are queryable as regular tables for reporting

**Limitation**: Complex SHACL shapes with multi-hop validation or logical combinators (`sh:or`, `sh:and`) would still need procedural triggers. Simple cardinality, datatype, and class constraints map well to stream tables.

### 2.6 Inference Materialization → Datalog Engine

> **Note**: This section describes the original hard-coded approach. It is **superseded** by the general Datalog reasoning engine described in [plans/ecosystem/datalog.md](datalog.md), which subsumes RDFS/OWL RL entailment and adds user-defined rules, stratified negation, and two execution modes (materialized via pg_trickle, on-demand via inline CTEs).

**Problem**: RDF inference (RDFS entailment: `rdfs:subClassOf`, `rdfs:subPropertyOf`, `owl:sameAs`) requires computing the transitive closure of class/property hierarchies. This is computationally expensive at query time.

**Original pg_trickle solution** (retained as a reference for the simpler case):

Materialize inferred triples as stream tables using `WITH RECURSIVE`.

```sql
-- Materialize transitive closure of rdfs:subClassOf
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name  => '_pg_ripple.inferred_subclass',
    query => $$
        WITH RECURSIVE closure(sub, super) AS (
            -- Direct subclass relationships
            SELECT s AS sub, o AS super
            FROM _pg_ripple.vp_99  -- rdfs:subClassOf
          UNION
            -- Transitive closure
            SELECT c.sub, sc.o AS super
            FROM closure c
            JOIN _pg_ripple.vp_99 sc ON sc.s = c.super
        )
        SELECT sub, super FROM closure
    $$,
    schedule => '30s'
);
```

**Recommended approach**: Use the Datalog engine's built-in RDFS rule set instead:

```sql
SELECT pg_ripple.load_rules_builtin('rdfs');
SELECT pg_ripple.materialize_rules(schedule => '30s');
```

This generates the same `WITH RECURSIVE` stream tables automatically for all 13 RDFS entailment rules (not just `rdfs:subClassOf`), with correct stratification and dependency ordering handled by the Datalog engine and pg_trickle's DAG scheduler.

### 2.7 Ontology Change Propagation

**Problem**: When an ontology changes (new classes, properties, or relationships), multiple derived structures need updating: ExtVP views, SHACL constraints, inference materializations, statistics.

**pg_trickle solution**: Model these as a DAG of stream tables:

```
Ontology triples (base)
    ├── inferred_subclass (stream table, WITH RECURSIVE)
    ├── inferred_subproperty (stream table, WITH RECURSIVE)
    ├── predicate_stats (stream table, GROUP BY)
    └── shacl_violations (stream table, NOT EXISTS)
         └── violation_summary (stream table, COUNT)
```

pg_trickle's DAG-aware scheduler automatically refreshes these in topological order when ontology triples change. Diamond-shaped dependencies (e.g., two views both depending on `rdf:type` and feeding into a summary) are handled atomically.

### 2.8 Rare-Predicate Auto-Promotion Trigger

**Problem**: `vp_rare` promotion — migrating a predicate's rows to a dedicated VP table when its triple count crosses `pg_ripple.vp_promotion_threshold` — is currently driven by the merge worker polling `COUNT(*) GROUP BY p` after each cycle. The detection lag equals the merge interval (default: when delta exceeds 100K rows), meaning a predicate that crosses the threshold between merges keeps accumulating in `vp_rare`, inflating full-table scans.

**pg_trickle solution**: An `IMMEDIATE` stream table watching `vp_rare` row counts fires the moment a predicate crosses the threshold within the same transaction:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name         => '_pg_ripple.rare_predicate_candidates',
    query        => $$
        SELECT p, COUNT(*) AS triple_count
        FROM _pg_ripple.vp_rare
        GROUP BY p
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= current_setting('pg_ripple.vp_promotion_threshold')::int
    $$,
    refresh_mode => 'IMMEDIATE'
);
```

Any row appearing in `_pg_ripple.rare_predicate_candidates` is a promotion candidate. The merge worker's promotion check becomes `SELECT p FROM _pg_ripple.rare_predicate_candidates` — a fast index scan on an almost-always-empty table — instead of a GROUP BY aggregate over all of `vp_rare`.

**Benefits**:
- Zero polling delay: promotion is triggered in the same transaction that crossed the threshold
- The merge worker's CPU spend on vp_rare promotion polling is eliminated
- The stream table is empty in steady state (prompting zero CDC overhead after promotion)

### 2.9 Incremental `dictionary_hot` Maintenance

**Problem**: The tiered dictionary (v0.10.0) uses `_pg_ripple.dictionary_hot` — an UNLOGGED table pre-warmed at startup via `pg_prewarm` — to keep the most-accessed IRIs in `shared_buffers`. After large data loads, newly-encoded predicate IRIs and prefix-registry IRIs are not in `dictionary_hot`, leading to cache misses on the hot decode path until the next manual rebuild.

**pg_trickle solution**: Model `dictionary_hot` itself as a stream table over `dictionary` filtered to hot-eligible terms:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.dictionary_hot',
    query    => $$
        SELECT id, hash, value, kind, datatype, lang
        FROM _pg_ripple.dictionary
        WHERE kind = 0  -- IRIs only
          AND (
              length(value) <= 512
              OR id IN (SELECT iri_id FROM _pg_ripple.prefix_registry)
              OR id IN (SELECT id  FROM _pg_ripple.predicates)
          )
    $$,
    schedule => '30s'
);
```

The `dictionary_hot` table is no longer a static snapshot but a continuously-maintained projection. New predicate IRIs and prefix-registry entries appear in `dictionary_hot` within 30 seconds of being encoded, without any manual rebuild call.

**Benefits**:
- Dictionary hot-path cache miss rate stays low after bulk loads — no manual intervention
- `pg_prewarm` at startup still warms the table; pg_trickle's incremental refresh keeps it current thereafter
- pg_trickle's differential mode only processes new `dictionary` rows, not the full table — negligible overhead

### 2.10 VP Table Cardinality for BGP Join Reordering

**Problem**: The SPARQL algebra optimizer's BGP join reorderer (v0.13.0) reads `pg_class.reltuples` for VP table cardinality estimates. Those statistics are only updated by `ANALYZE`, which runs post-merge. Between merges — which may be many minutes apart on write-heavy workloads — the delta partition accumulates rows but `reltuples` stays at its last-merge value. The reorderer therefore makes sub-optimal join ordering decisions during high-write windows.

**pg_trickle solution**: A live per-predicate row count stream table updated more frequently than `ANALYZE` cycle time:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.vp_cardinality',
    query    => $$
        SELECT p AS predicate_id, COUNT(*) AS approx_count
        FROM _pg_ripple.all_triples_view  -- UNION ALL of delta + main for every VP table
        GROUP BY p
    $$,
    schedule => '5s'
);
```

The SPARQL algebrizer checks `_pg_ripple.vp_cardinality` first when `pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available()` is true; it falls back to `pg_class.reltuples` otherwise. Because the stream table is maintained differentially, it tracks delta inserts in near-real-time without requiring a full VP table scan.

**Benefits**:
- Join ordering remains accurate during write-heavy bursts between `ANALYZE` cycles
- Complements the existing statistics infrastructure — does not replace `ANALYZE`
- An existing `predicate_stats` stream table (§2.4) could serve the same purpose; `vp_cardinality` is a lighter, faster alternative (no distinct subject/object counts)

> **Note**: `_pg_ripple.predicate_stats` (§2.4) already tracks `triple_count` per predicate. If that stream table is enabled, `vp_cardinality` is redundant — the algebrizer should read `predicate_stats.triple_count` directly instead of creating a second stream table.

### 2.11 Federation Endpoint Health Monitoring

**Problem**: The SPARQL federation module (v0.16.0) has an `_pg_ripple.federation_endpoints` allow-list but no live health tracking. The executor currently attempts every registered endpoint regardless of recent error history, meaning a single unreachable endpoint can block query execution for the full `pg_ripple.federation_timeout` duration on every query.

**pg_trickle solution**: A stream table aggregating a probe log by endpoint provides a live health view:

```sql
-- Base table populated by a lightweight probe worker or after each SERVICE call
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.federation_probe_log (
    endpoint_url  TEXT NOT NULL,
    success       BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    latency_ms    INT,
    probed_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.federation_health',
    query    => $$
        SELECT endpoint_url,
               COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success)     AS success_count,
               COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT success) AS error_count,
               AVG(latency_ms)                     AS avg_latency_ms,
               MAX(probed_at)                      AS last_probe_at,
               (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE success)::float /
                NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0))               AS success_rate
        FROM _pg_ripple.federation_probe_log
        WHERE probed_at > now() - interval '5 minutes'
        GROUP BY endpoint_url
    $$,
    schedule => '10s'
);
```

The federation executor does a fast `SELECT success_rate FROM _pg_ripple.federation_health WHERE endpoint_url = $1` pre-flight check. Endpoints with `success_rate < 0.1` are skipped immediately (or downgraded to WARNING) without waiting for timeout. The `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint reads directly from `federation_health` — no aggregate scan required.

**Benefits**:
- Unhealthy endpoints are detected within 10 seconds of consistent failures
- Pre-flight health check avoids per-query timeout waits on dead endpoints
- The stream table doubles as a federation performance dashboard
- pg_trickle's window-aggregation support keeps the rolling 5-minute window maintenance efficient

### 2.12 Incremental `subject_patterns` Maintenance

**Problem**: The `_pg_ripple.subject_patterns` table (v0.6.0) maps each subject to a sorted `BIGINT[]` of all its predicate IDs. It powers DESCRIBE queries (look up a subject's predicates in one index seek instead of probing every VP table) and GIN-based "subject has both P1 and P2" scans. Currently maintained by the merge worker post-merge only — between merges, newly inserted triples are invisible to the pattern index, forcing fallback to full VP table enumeration.

**pg_trickle solution**: A stream table maintaining the per-subject predicate array incrementally:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.subject_patterns',
    query    => $$
        SELECT s,
               array_agg(DISTINCT p ORDER BY p) AS pattern
        FROM _pg_ripple.all_triples_view
        GROUP BY s
    $$,
    schedule => '10s'
);
CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.subject_patterns USING GIN (pattern);
```

pg_trickle's GROUP BY + `array_agg` differential maintenance handles this efficiently: only subjects whose predicate set changed since the last refresh are recomputed. The GIN index is updated incrementally by PostgreSQL on each stream table refresh.

**Benefits**:
- DESCRIBE queries see predicates from delta-resident triples without waiting for a merge cycle
- GIN-based "subjects with predicates P1 AND P2" queries stay current during high-write windows
- Merge worker no longer needs dedicated subject-pattern rebuild logic — pg_trickle handles it
- The stream table replaces the static table entirely; no data duplication

### 2.13 SHACL Dead-Letter Queue Violation Summary

**Problem**: The async SHACL validation pipeline (§4.6.2 in the implementation plan) dumps complex-shape violations into `_pg_ripple.dead_letter_queue` with per-violation JSONB reports. Answering "how many violations of each shape are there right now?" requires a full `GROUP BY` scan of the queue. As the queue grows (large initial loads often produce millions of violations before cleanup), this query dominates monitoring latency.

**pg_trickle solution**: A stream table aggregating the dead-letter queue by shape and violation type:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.violation_summary',
    query    => $$
        SELECT dlq.report ->> 'sourceShape'     AS shape_iri,
               dlq.report ->> 'resultSeverity'   AS severity,
               (dlq.report ->> 'graph_id')::bigint AS graph_id,
               COUNT(*)                           AS violation_count,
               MAX(dlq.queued_at)                 AS last_seen
        FROM _pg_ripple.dead_letter_queue dlq
        GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
    $$,
    schedule => '5s'
);
```

The v0.15.0 HTTP endpoint's `/metrics` Prometheus exporter reads `violation_summary` directly — one index scan on a small aggregate table instead of a full GROUP BY over potentially millions of violation rows.

**Benefits**:
- Monitoring dashboards get sub-second violation counts without full queue scans
- Prometheus `/metrics` exporter stays cheap even with millions of queued violations
- `JSONB ->>` field extraction is evaluated only for changed rows — pg_trickle's differential mode avoids re-aggregating the entire queue
- Feeds into the ontology change propagation DAG (§2.7): violations that disappear after a schema change are automatically cleared from the summary

### 2.14 Automatic ExtVP Recommendation

**Problem**: ExtVP (§2.1) pre-computes semi-joins between frequently co-joined predicates for 2–10× star-pattern speedups. But deciding *which* predicate pairs to pre-compute requires workload analysis. The current plan (v0.11.0) leaves this entirely manual — users must guess which pairs to `create_sparql_view()` for.

**pg_trickle solution**: A stream table aggregating co-occurring predicate pairs from the SPARQL query execution log, surfacing the top N ExtVP candidates automatically:

```sql
-- Base: the SPARQL query engine logs BGP predicate arrays on each execution
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.query_predicate_log (
    bgp_predicates BIGINT[] NOT NULL,
    query_time_ms  INT NOT NULL,
    executed_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.extvp_candidates',
    query    => $$
        SELECT p1, p2,
               COUNT(*)            AS cooccurrence_count,
               AVG(query_time_ms)  AS avg_query_ms
        FROM _pg_ripple.query_predicate_log,
             LATERAL unnest(bgp_predicates) AS p1,
             LATERAL unnest(bgp_predicates) AS p2
        WHERE p1 < p2
          AND executed_at > now() - interval '1 hour'
        GROUP BY p1, p2
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
    $$,
    schedule => '30s'
);
```

A periodic admin function or the merge worker reads `extvp_candidates` and auto-creates ExtVP stream tables for the top predicate pairs. Users get workload-adaptive performance tuning with zero manual intervention.

**Benefits**:
- Removes guesswork from ExtVP configuration
- Adapts to changing workloads — predicate pairs that fall out of the 1-hour window are automatically de-prioritised
- Feeds into `pg_ripple.explain_sparql()` recommendations: "This query would benefit from an ExtVP on (P1, P2) — run `pg_ripple.create_extvp(P1, P2)` to speed it up"

### 2.15 Incremental Ontology / Schema Extraction

**Problem**: Knowledge graph users need to understand the schema: "What classes exist? What properties does each class have? What are the cardinalities?" This currently requires manual exploration or external tooling. There is no live, queryable schema summary inside pg_ripple.

**pg_trickle solution**: A stream table continuously inferring a queryable class–property schema from the data itself:

```sql
SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table(
    name     => '_pg_ripple.inferred_schema',
    query    => $$
        -- Per-class property usage
        SELECT type_vp.o                           AS class_id,
               prop.p                              AS property_id,
               COUNT(DISTINCT prop.s)              AS instance_count,
               COUNT(*)                            AS triple_count,
               COUNT(DISTINCT prop.o)              AS distinct_values
        FROM _pg_ripple.all_triples_view type_vp   -- rdf:type triples
        JOIN _pg_ripple.all_triples_view prop
          ON prop.s = type_vp.s
        WHERE type_vp.p = (SELECT id FROM _pg_ripple.predicates
                           WHERE iri_id = encode('http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type'))
        GROUP BY type_vp.o, prop.p
    $$,
    schedule => '30s'
);
```

Applications query `_pg_ripple.inferred_schema` (decoded via a thin view) to discover the graph's structure. SPARQL IDE UIs can use it for auto-completion. SHACL shape generation tools can read it as a starting point. The stream table stays incrementally current as new triples flow in.

**Benefits**:
- Queryable schema summary with zero manual maintenance
- Auto-completion for SPARQL editors connected via the HTTP endpoint (v0.15.0)
- Feed for automatic SHACL shape inference tooling
- pg_trickle's differential GROUP BY maintenance makes this near-zero cost at low change rates

### Extension Dependency

pg_trickle is an **optional dependency** of pg_ripple. The control file declares no hard requirement:

```ini
# pg_ripple.control
requires = ''  # pg_trickle is optional; detected at call time
```

#### Soft detection at call time

pg_ripple never checks for pg_trickle during `_PG_init`. Functions that require it probe `pg_catalog.pg_extension` at the moment they are called and raise `ERRCODE_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` with a clear install hint if it is absent:

```rust
fn require_pg_trickle(feature: &str) {
    let installed = Spi::get_one::<bool>(
        "SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trickle')"
    )
    .unwrap_or(Some(false))
    .unwrap_or(false);

    if !installed {
        ereport!(
            PgLogLevel::ERROR,
            PgSqlErrorCode::ERRCODE_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED,
            &format!("{} requires the pg_trickle extension", feature),
            "Install it with: CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle"
        );
    }
}

#[pg_extern]
fn create_sparql_view(name: &str, sparql: &str, schedule: &str, decode: bool) {
    require_pg_trickle("create_sparql_view");

    // Parse SPARQL → SQL
    let sql = sparql_to_sql(sparql);

    // Register in catalog
    Spi::run_with_args(
        "INSERT INTO _pg_ripple.sparql_views \
         (name, sparql, generated_sql, schedule, decode, stream_table, created_at) \
         VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $1, now())",
        &[name.into(), sparql.into(), sql.into(), schedule.into(), decode.into()],
    );

    // Create stream table via pg_trickle
    Spi::run_with_args(
        "SELECT pgtrickle.create_stream_table($1, $2, schedule => $3)",
        &[name.into(), sql.into(), schedule.into()],
    );
}
```

#### User-visible availability check

```sql
-- Returns TRUE when pg_trickle is installed, FALSE otherwise — never errors
SELECT pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available();
```

This lets applications and tooling test availability before calling without catching exceptions.

#### Capability table

| Feature | Without pg_trickle | With pg_trickle |
|---|---|---|
| SPARQL SELECT / ASK / CONSTRUCT / DESCRIBE | Full | Full |
| Triple load and SPARQL Update | Full | Full |
| Datalog on-demand mode | Full | Full |
| SHACL validation (synchronous) | Full | Full |
| `pg_ripple.stats()` | Catalog scan on every call | Read from `predicate_stats` stream table |
| `create_sparql_view()` | `ERROR` with install hint | Available |
| `create_datalog_view()` | `ERROR` with install hint | Available |
| ExtVP semi-join tables | Not available | Available |
| Inference materialised mode | Not available | Differential refresh |
| SHACL violation monitors (async) | Not available | `IMMEDIATE` in-transaction |

---

## 4. Roadmap Integration

| pg_ripple Version | pg_trickle Feature | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| v0.6.0 (HTAP) | Real-time statistics (`predicate_stats`, `graph_stats`); rare-predicate auto-promotion (`rare_predicate_candidates`); live VP cardinality (`vp_cardinality`); incremental `subject_patterns` | High |
| v0.7.0 (SHACL Core) | SHACL violation monitors (IMMEDIATE mode); dead-letter queue violation summary (`violation_summary`) | Medium |
| v0.8.0 (SHACL Advanced) | Multi-shape DAG validation | Medium |
| v0.10.0 (Datalog) | Inference materialization via Datalog rule sets, SHACL-AF `sh:rule` bridge; incremental `dictionary_hot` maintenance | High |
| v0.11.0 (SPARQL & Datalog Views) | ExtVP stream tables, `pg_ripple.create_sparql_view()` API, Datalog views, SPARQL view caching | High |
| v0.13.0 (Performance) | Automatic ExtVP recommendation (`extvp_candidates`) | Medium |
| v0.14.0 (Admin) | Incremental ontology / schema extraction (`inferred_schema`) | Medium |
| v0.16.0 (Federation) | Federation endpoint health monitoring (`federation_health`) | Medium |
| Post-1.0 | Full ExtVP automation driven by `extvp_candidates`, ontology change propagation DAG | High |

---

## 5. Performance Implications

### Wins

| Scenario | Without pg_trickle | With pg_trickle | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pg_ripple.stats()` | Full scan of all VP tables | Read from `predicate_stats` stream table | 100–1000× |
| Star query (cached) | 5-way VP join + dict decode | Single table scan | 10–50× |
| `rdfs:subClassOf*` traversal | Recursive CTE at query time | Read materialized closure | 5–20× |
| ExtVP semi-join | Not available (full VP join) | Pre-computed stream table | 2–10× |
| SHACL check | Scan + validate post-insert | IMMEDIATE mode — in-transaction | Same latency, no async lag |

### Costs

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Write-path overhead (CDC triggers) | pg_trickle's hybrid CDC: 20–55 µs/row trigger, ~5 µs/row WAL mode. Acceptable given VP tables are already I/O-bound on inserts. |
| Memory for stream table storage | Stream tables are heap tables — standard PG memory management. ExtVP views are subsets of VP tables, so storage is bounded. |
| Scheduler CPU | pg_trickle's zero-change overhead is 3.2ms average. With 10–20 stream tables, scheduling adds <100ms/sec total CPU. |
| Extension coupling | pg_trickle is optional; all core pg_ripple features work without it. |

---

## 6. Shared Tech Stack Advantages

Both extensions share the identical technology foundation:

| Aspect | pg_ripple | pg_trickle |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Rust (Edition 2024) | Rust (Edition 2024) |
| PG binding | pgrx 0.17 | pgrx 0.17 |
| Target PG | 18 | 18 |
| Background workers | pgrx `BackgroundWorker` | pgrx `BackgroundWorker` |
| SPI usage | Extensive | Extensive |
| Shared memory | Dictionary cache | Change buffers, DAG state |

This means:
- **No ABI incompatibility risk**: Both compiled against the same pgrx version targeting PG18
- **Shared development knowledge**: Patterns learned in one project transfer directly
- **Shared CI/CD**: Same `cargo pgrx test`, `cargo pgrx regress`, Docker-based testing infrastructure
- **Potential code sharing**: Common pgrx utilities (SPI helpers, GUC patterns, BGW patterns) could be extracted into a shared crate

---

## 7. Deployment Model

### Minimal (pg_ripple only)

```ini
# postgresql.conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_ripple'
```

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple;
-- Full triple store, no stream tables
```

### Enhanced (pg_ripple + pg_trickle)

```ini
# postgresql.conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_trickle, pg_ripple'
max_worker_processes = 16
```

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple;

-- Now these work:
SELECT pg_ripple.create_sparql_view('my_view', 'SELECT ?s ?name WHERE { ... }');
SELECT pg_ripple.enable_inference_materialization();
SELECT pg_ripple.enable_live_statistics();
```

### Docker / CNPG

Both extensions ship as OCI images for CloudNativePG, making combined deployment straightforward:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    shared_preload_libraries: [pg_trickle, pg_ripple]
    extensions:
      - name: pg-trickle
        image:
          reference: ghcr.io/trickle-labs/pg_trickle-ext:0.17.0
      - name: pg-ripple
        image:
          reference: ghcr.io/trickle-labs/pg-ripple-ext:1.0.0
```

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| pg_trickle API changes (pre-1.0) | Low | Medium | All pg_trickle calls are isolated behind `require_pg_trickle` + thin Spi wrappers. Pin to a tested pg_trickle version in `Cargo.toml`; update and re-run integration tests when bumping. |
| CDC trigger conflicts (both extensions adding triggers) | Low | High | pg_ripple's VP tables are internal (`_pg_ripple` schema); pg_trickle CDC triggers are per-table and non-conflicting. Verify in integration tests. |
| Background worker slot exhaustion | Low | Medium | Document `max_worker_processes` sizing: pg_trickle needs 2–3, pg_ripple merge worker needs 1, plus custom needs |
| Shared memory contention | Low | Low | Different shared memory segments; no overlap. pg_trickle uses its own shmem for DAG state; pg_ripple uses its own for dictionary cache |

---

## 9. Recommendations

1. **Start with statistics** (v0.6.0): The lowest-risk, highest-value integration point. Create stream tables for `predicate_stats` and `graph_stats` when pg_trickle is detected. This validates the integration pattern with minimal complexity.

2. **Add SPARQL views** (v0.11.0): The `pg_ripple.create_sparql_view()` function is the user-facing killer feature. It combines pg_ripple's SPARQL→SQL translation with pg_trickle's IVM to give users always-fresh materialized SPARQL query results.

3. **Materialize inference** (v0.10.0): RDFS/OWL inference via the Datalog engine's built-in rule sets, materialized as `WITH RECURSIVE` stream tables — a differentiator no other PostgreSQL-based triple store offers.

4. **Defer ExtVP automation** (post-1.0): While stream tables are the right mechanism for ExtVP, the query workload analysis needed to *decide which* semi-joins to pre-compute is complex. Start with manual `create_sparql_view()` and automate later.

5. **Keep pg_trickle optional**: Core triple store functionality must never depend on pg_trickle. The integration should be a "power-user" layer that enhances performance and enables advanced features.

---

## 10. Summary

pg_trickle is a natural complement to pg_ripple. Where pg_ripple provides the storage model (dictionary encoding + vertical partitioning) and query language (SPARQL→SQL), pg_trickle provides the *reactivity layer* — keeping derived views, statistics, inference materializations, and cached query results incrementally up-to-date as the underlying graph changes.

The shared technology stack (Rust, pgrx 0.17, PostgreSQL 18) eliminates integration friction. pg_trickle's strong SQL coverage — including JOINs, aggregates, EXISTS, and `WITH RECURSIVE` — aligns precisely with the SQL patterns that pg_ripple's SPARQL translator generates.

The recommended integration path is progressive: start with live statistics (low risk, high value), add SPARQL views (user-facing feature), then layer in inference materialization and eventually automated ExtVP. At every stage pg_trickle remains optional, and the core triple store stands alone.
