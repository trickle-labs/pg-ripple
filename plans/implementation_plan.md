# pg_ripple — Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**pg_ripple** is a PostgreSQL 18 extension written in Rust using pgrx 0.18 that implements a high-performance, scalable RDF triple store. It brings native SPARQL query capability, dictionary-encoded storage with vertical partitioning, HTAP architecture, SHACL validation, and optional distributed execution—all within PostgreSQL.

### Design Principles

- **Performance first**: Dictionary-encoded integers, vertical partitioning, zero-copy Rust data paths
- **PostgreSQL-native**: Leverage the optimizer, MVCC, WAL, parallel query, AIO (PG18), and skip scan
- **Safe Rust**: Use pgrx 0.18's safe abstractions; `unsafe` only at FFI boundaries where required
- **Incremental adoption**: Usable from the first release; advanced features layered progressively
- **Standards compliance**: W3C RDF 1.1, SPARQL 1.1, SHACL Core

## 4. Module Breakdown

### 4.1 Extension Bootstrap (`src/lib.rs`)

- pgrx `#[pg_extern]` entry points
- `_PG_init()` hook for background worker startup (v0.6.0+: also shared memory registration)
- GUC parameters: `pg_ripple.default_graph`, `pg_ripple.dictionary_cache_size`, `pg_ripple.merge_threshold`, `pg_ripple.shacl_mode`, `pg_ripple.inference_mode`, `pg_ripple.named_graph_optimized` (adds G-leading index on each VP table; off by default) — see §4.11 for the full canonical GUC reference
- **GUC-gated lazy initialization**: the merge worker, SHACL validator, and reasoning engine are only started when their respective GUCs (`pg_ripple.merge_threshold > 0`, `pg_ripple.shacl_mode != 'off'`, `pg_ripple.inference_mode != 'off'`) are active. `_PG_init` never starts subsystems the user has not enabled. See §4.11 for the full canonical GUC reference.
- **Error taxonomy module** (`src/error.rs`, v0.1.0): `thiserror`-based error types with PT error code constants. Initial ranges: dictionary errors (PT001–PT099) and storage errors (PT100–PT199). PostgreSQL-style formatting: lowercase first word, no trailing period. Extended in subsequent milestones as new subsystems are added (see §13.6 for the complete range table).
- **Dictionary cache phasing**: v0.1.0–v0.5.1 use a **backend-local** `lru::LruCache` for the dictionary cache — no `shared_preload_libraries` required. The shared-memory dictionary cache, bloom filters, slot versioning, and `pg_ripple.shared_memory_size` startup GUC are all introduced in v0.6.0 when the HTAP architecture requires cross-backend coordination. This significantly simplifies the first 6 releases and defers the most complex pgrx API surface to when it is actually needed.
- **Shared-memory slot versioning** (v0.6.0+): the first 16 bytes of every `PgSharedMem` slot are a fixed magic number followed by a 4-byte layout version integer. On startup the extension checks both; a mismatch (e.g. after an in-place upgrade) triggers a controlled re-initialization rather than a silent crash.
- **pgrx 0.18 shared memory API** (v0.6.0+): the shared memory surface in pgrx 0.18 uses the `PgSharedObject` trait and `PgSharedMem::new_array` / `PgSharedMem::new_object` constructors — a substantial redesign from the `PgSharedMem` API used in pgrx ≤0.14. The implementation must follow the [pgrx 0.18 shared memory examples](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/tree/develop/pgrx-examples/shmem) and declare all allocation sizes at `_PG_init` time via the `pg_shmem_init!` macro. Shared memory block size is determined at postmaster start by the `pg_ripple.shared_memory_size` GUC (a startup GUC in `postgresql.conf`); it cannot be grown at runtime. The `pg_ripple.cache_budget` GUC is a utilization cap enforced in Rust, not a re-allocation signal.
- Extension SQL: `CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple` creates core schema and catalog tables

### 4.2 Dictionary Encoder (`src/dictionary/`)

**Purpose**: Map every IRI, blank node, and literal to a compact `i64` identifier.

#### 4.2.1 Schema

A single unified dictionary table holds all term types (IRIs, blank nodes, and literals). Using one table with one IDENTITY sequence guarantees that every dictionary ID is globally unique — the decode path can always resolve an `i64` to exactly one term without ambiguity. This is the approach used by RDF4J, Blazegraph, and Oxigraph.

```sql
-- Unified dictionary (IRIs, blank nodes, and literals)
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.dictionary (
    id        BIGINT   GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    hash      BYTEA    NOT NULL,  -- full 16-byte XXH3-128 of (kind_le_bytes || term_utf8)
    value     TEXT     NOT NULL,
    kind      SMALLINT NOT NULL,  -- 0=IRI, 1=blank node, 2=literal, 3=typed-literal, 4=lang-literal
    datatype  TEXT,               -- for literals: xsd datatype IRI (kind=3)
    lang      TEXT                -- for language-tagged literals (kind=4)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.dictionary (hash);
```

> **Design decision — Hash-Backed Sequence (Route 2)**: The XXH3-128 hash is stored in full (16 bytes, `BYTEA`) and used as the *collision-detection key* via `ON CONFLICT (hash) DO NOTHING`. The dense `i64` join key used in every VP table is the IDENTITY-generated `id` — a sequential integer independent of the hash. This avoids the birthday-problem collision risk of schemes that truncate the 128-bit hash to 64 bits (collision expected around 4 billion terms in the 64-bit variant). The `kind` discriminant is mixed into the hash input as two little-endian bytes — so the same string encoded as an IRI and as a blank node always maps to distinct rows. For the encode path, this yields an `ENCODE_CACHE` keyed on the full `u128` hash.

> **Earlier alternative rejected**: Separate `resource_dict` and `literal_dict` tables, each with their own IDENTITY sequence, create an ID space collision — `resource_dict.id = 42` and `literal_dict.id = 42` can both exist, making the decode path ambiguous. A unified table eliminates this class of bugs at zero performance cost (lookups are by `id` primary key or `hash` unique index — both $O(1)$ regardless of table size).

#### 4.2.2 Implementation

- **Encoding path** (`encode(term, kind)`): Compute XXH3-128 over `kind_le_bytes || term_utf8` → check `ENCODE_CACHE (u128 → i64)` for a cache hit → `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (hash) DO NOTHING RETURNING id` → if no row returned (conflict), `SELECT id … WHERE hash = $1` → populate both caches → return the IDENTITY `i64`
- **Decoding path** (`decode(id)`): `i64` → `DECODE_CACHE (i64 → String)` → `SELECT value … WHERE id = $1` → populate cache → return string
- **Batch decoding** (`decode_batch()`): Collect all output `i64` IDs from a result set, resolve in a single `WHERE id = ANY(...)` query, build an in-memory `HashMap<i64, String>`, then emit decoded rows. Avoids per-row dictionary round-trips — critical for large result sets
- **Batch encoding** (`encode_batch()`): Bulk insert with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + `RETURNING`, minimising round-trips during data load
- **Blank node document-scoping** (`src/dictionary/bnode.rs`): Each bulk load call (and each `INSERT DATA` statement) is assigned a monotonically-increasing `load_generation BIGINT` from another shared sequence. Blank node labels are hashed as `"{generation}:{label}"` rather than `"{label}"` — so `_:b0` from load call #5 hashes as `"5:b0"` and `_:b0` from load call #6 hashes as `"6:b0"`, yielding distinct dictionary IDs. This isolation is mandatory for correct multi-file RDF loading and is in effect from v0.2.0. The `load_generation` is stored in a thread-local / SPI-session context and advanced at the start of each top-level load operation.
- **Per-query `EncodingCache`** (`src/dictionary/query_cache.rs`): A short-lived `HashMap<&str, i64>` allocated at the start of each SPARQL query and discarded when the query exits. Constants appearing multiple times in a pattern (e.g. the same IRI in multiple BGPs) are encoded once and reused within the same query without hitting the shared-memory LRU or the database. Distinct from `encode_batch()` which is used during data load.
- **In-memory cache** (phased implementation):
  - **v0.1.0–v0.5.1**: backend-local `lru::LruCache<u128, i64>` — simple, no shared memory required, no `shared_preload_libraries` dependency. Each backend has its own cache; cache misses hit the dictionary tables via SPI.
  - **v0.6.0+**: `HashMap<u128, i64>` in shared memory via pgrx `PgSharedMem`, **sharded into N buckets** (default: 64) with per-shard lightweight locks to eliminate global lock contention under concurrent workloads. Sized by GUC.
- **Shared-memory budget** (v0.6.0+): `pg_ripple.cache_budget` GUC governs the *utilization cap* of the pre-allocated shared memory block — it is enforced in Rust and does not cause PostgreSQL to allocate additional memory. The complementary startup GUC `pg_ripple.shared_memory_size` (set in `postgresql.conf`) declares the actual block size to PostgreSQL in `_PG_init`; it must be ≥ `cache_budget` and cannot be changed without a postmaster restart. Automatic eviction priority: bloom filters first, then oldest LRU dictionary entries. Back-pressure on bulk loads when utilisation exceeds 90% of `cache_budget`.
- **Prefix compression**: Common IRI prefixes (registered via `pg_ripple.register_prefix()`) are stripped from the `value` column before storage and the expansion is held separately in the prefix registry. The stored `value` contains only the local part (e.g. `"Person"` rather than `"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"`). The XXH3-128 **hash is computed over the full expanded IRI** to maintain globally unique collision-resistant IDs — not over the compressed form. The benefit is storage compression (~40% reduction in `value` column size for typical prefix-heavy RDF datasets), not hash-space compression. Decoding reconstructs the full IRI by joining the local part with the registered expansion.
- **Inline value encoding** (`src/dictionary/inline.rs`, v0.5.1): Type-tagged i64 values for `xsd:integer`, `xsd:boolean`, `xsd:dateTime`, `xsd:date`. Deferred from v0.3.0 to keep the initial SPARQL engine focused on a single ID space; the dual-space model is introduced once the query engine is stable (v0.5.1, after v0.5.0 completes query-engine work). Bit 63 set signals an inline value; bits 56–62 hold a 7-bit type code; bits 0–55 hold the encoded value. FILTER comparisons on these types require zero dictionary round-trips — the SPARQL→SQL translator encodes constants at translation time and emits a plain B-tree range condition on the VP column.

  **Assigned inline type codes**:

  | Code (7-bit) | xsd datatype | Encoding of bits 0–55 |
  |---|---|---|
  | `0` | `xsd:integer` | Two's complement signed 56-bit integer |
  | `1` | `xsd:boolean` | `0` = false, `1` = true |
  | `2` | `xsd:dateTime` | Microseconds since Unix epoch (UTC) |
  | `3` | `xsd:date` | Days since Unix epoch |
  | `4`–`127` | Reserved | For future typed literals (decimal, double, duration, etc.) |

  > **Why no `xsd:double`?** Truncating IEEE 754 binary64 to 56 bits (removing 8 exponent/mantissa bits) produces undefined precision and range limits. Since range comparisons on doubles are uncommon in SPARQL, `xsd:double` values are stored in the dictionary table where lossless encoding is guaranteed. If inline double support is needed in the future, code `4` could use IEEE 754 binary32 (float) in 32 of the 56 available bits, giving well-understood 7-digit precision.

  IRI-based dictionary IDs always have bit 63 = 0, so the inline and non-inline ranges are disjoint.
- **ID ordering** (v0.5.1): Typed-literal IDs are allocated in monotonically increasing semantic order within each type (integers by numeric value, dates chronologically). This enables FILTER range conditions to compile to `BETWEEN $lo AND $hi` scans on the raw i64 column without decoding. The integer and date ranges are disjoint from IRI ranges via the type-tag bits.
- **Tiered dictionary** (`src/dictionary/hot.rs`, v0.10.0): `_pg_ripple.dictionary_hot` (UNLOGGED, stays in `shared_buffers`) holds IRIs ≤512 bytes, all prefix-registry IRIs, and all predicate IRIs. `_pg_ripple.dictionary` (heap) remains the full table; the encoder checks the hot table first. `pg_prewarm` warms `dictionary_hot` at server start via `_PG_init`. At Wikidata scale (3B vocabulary entries, 190 GB uncompressed), this keeps the hot lookup path I/O-free for the overwhelming majority of query-time decodes.

### 4.3 Storage Engine (`src/storage/`)

**Purpose**: Physically store triples as integer tuples in vertically partitioned tables.

#### 4.3.1 Vertical Partitioning

Each unique predicate `p` gets its own table:

```sql
-- Created once at extension bootstrap (v0.1.0+):
CREATE SEQUENCE _pg_ripple.statement_id_seq;

CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id} (
    s       BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- subject dictionary ID
    o       BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- object dictionary ID
    g       BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- named graph ID (0 = default)
    i       BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('_pg_ripple.statement_id_seq')  -- globally-unique statement identifier (SID)
    -- source SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 added by v0.10.0 migration
);
CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id} (s, o);
CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id} (o, s);
-- Created only when pg_ripple.named_graph_optimized = true:
-- CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id} (g, s, o);
```

> **Why a shared sequence?** Using `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` gives each VP table its own private sequence, meaning two different VP tables can both produce `i = 1`. RDF-star (v0.4.0) requires SIDs to be globally unique — they must appear as subjects or objects in *other* VP tables and be unambiguously resolved via `_pg_ripple.statements`. A single shared `statement_id_seq` sequence guarantees global uniqueness across all VP tables and `vp_rare`.

- Tables are created dynamically on first encounter of a new predicate during data ingestion
- A catalog table `_pg_ripple.predicates` maps predicate dictionary IDs to table OIDs for fast lookup
- PG18's **skip scan** on the composite B-tree indices enables efficient lookups even when only the second column (`o`) is bound
- **`i` column (Statement Identifier)** (v0.1.0): Every statement gets a globally-unique `BIGINT` drawn from the shared `_pg_ripple.statement_id_seq` sequence. Using a shared sequence (rather than per-table `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`) guarantees that no two rows across any VP table or `vp_rare` share the same SID — a prerequisite for RDF-star (v0.4.0), where a SID can appear in the `s` or `o` column of any other VP table and must be unambiguously resolvable. This makes the storage schema SPOI-compatible (inspired by the OneGraph 1G model).

  **`_pg_ripple.statements` catalog** (v0.2.0): A lightweight **range-mapping table** — not a view unioning all VP table rows — is maintained by the merge worker to support SID lookups:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.statements (
      sid_min     BIGINT NOT NULL,
      sid_max     BIGINT NOT NULL,
      predicate_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
      table_oid   OID NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (sid_min)
  );
  ```

  After each merge cycle the worker inserts one range row per VP table covering the SIDs allocated since the last merge. Because SIDs are drawn from a monotonically increasing sequence, ranges are non-overlapping and a binary search on `sid_min` resolves any SID to its owning VP table in $O(\log n)$ with no full-table scans. Rows in `vp_rare` are also covered: since `vp_rare` does not split, its SIDs span multiple ranges but the predicate is stored inline per `vp_rare` row, so a fallback `SELECT predicate_id FROM _pg_ripple.vp_rare WHERE i = $1` is used for unmatched ranges (rare, as `vp_rare` rows are eventually promoted).
- **`source` column** (v0.10.0): `SMALLINT DEFAULT 0` — `0` = explicit triple asserted by the user; `1` = derived triple produced by the Datalog/RDFS/OWL RL reasoning engine. Added to every dedicated VP table **and to `_pg_ripple.vp_rare`** via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN source SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` in the v0.10.0 migration script. This is a zero-downtime fast-path column addition in PostgreSQL — no table rewrite. Queries can pass `include_derived := false` to filter to `WHERE source = 0` only. Because the column is added as part of the v0.10.0 migration script, it has zero cost before reasoning is enabled.
- **Named-graph index** (`pg_ripple.named_graph_optimized = true`): when enabled, each VP table gains an additional `(g, s, o)` index supporting `GRAPH ?g { ... }` patterns without a full-table scan. Off by default to avoid index bloat for single-graph users.

**Rare-Predicate Consolidation**:
- Predicates with fewer than `pg_ripple.vp_promotion_threshold` triples (default: 1,000) are stored in a shared `_pg_ripple.vp_rare (p BIGINT, s BIGINT, o BIGINT, g BIGINT, i BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('_pg_ripple.statement_id_seq'))` table with three secondary indices:
  - `(p, s, o)` — primary access pattern: all triples for a given predicate
  - `(s, p)` — DESCRIBE queries: enumerate all predicates for a given subject without a full-table scan
  - `(g, p, s, o)` — graph-drop: enumerate and bulk-delete all triples in a named graph
- Once a predicate crosses the threshold, its rows are auto-migrated to a dedicated VP table and the catalog updated — transparent to callers
- Promotion is **deferred to end-of-statement**: during bulk loads, triples accumulate in `vp_rare`; after the load completes (or during the next merge worker cycle), predicates exceeding the threshold are promoted in a single `INSERT … SELECT` + `DELETE` transaction
- `pg_ripple.promote_rare_predicates()` can also be called manually
- Prevents catalog bloat for predicate-rich datasets (DBpedia ≈60K predicates, Wikidata ≈10K predicates) — avoids hundreds of thousands of PostgreSQL objects, reduces planner overhead, and cuts VACUUM cost
- **`vp_rare` is exempt from the HTAP delta/main split** (v0.6.0+): rare predicates see few writes by definition, so a dual-partition layout adds overhead for negligible benefit. `vp_rare` remains a single flat table throughout the HTAP migration and after. Concurrent read/write safety relies on PostgreSQL row-level locking (the table is accessed under standard heap locking — no extra row locks required). The bloom filter for delta existence checks treats `vp_rare` as always "in-delta" (i.e., no cached main-only shortcut applies), which is conservative and correct.

#### 4.3.2 HTAP Dual-Partition Architecture

> **Version note**: The delta/main split is introduced in **v0.6.0** via a schema migration (see ROADMAP v0.6.0). Versions v0.1.0–v0.5.1 use a single flat VP table per predicate — all reads and writes target that same table. The architecture described below is the v0.6.0+ steady-state. The `UNION ALL delta + main` query path, bloom filter, and background merge worker are all v0.6.0 deliverables.

**Delta Partition** (write-optimized):
- Standard heap tables with B-tree indices
- All INSERTs and DELETEs target the delta partition
- Small enough to remain in `shared_buffers`

**Main Partition** (read-optimized):
- BRIN-indexed, physically sorted by subject via `INSERT ... ORDER BY` during generation merge
- Populated by the background merge worker
- Uses PG18 async I/O for faster sequential scans

**Tombstone Table** (v0.6.0+):
- When deleting a triple that may exist in `_main`, the delete is recorded in `_pg_ripple.vp_{id}_tombstones (s BIGINT, o BIGINT, g BIGINT)`
- Query path becomes: `(main EXCEPT tombstones) UNION ALL delta`
- The merge worker applies tombstones against main during each generation merge, then truncates the tombstone table
- Necessary because `_main` is read-only between merges — a DELETE targeting a main-resident triple cannot modify `_main` directly

**Merge Worker** (background worker via pgrx `BackgroundWorker`):
- Periodically merges delta into main when delta exceeds `pg_ripple.merge_threshold` rows
- Runs as a pgrx background worker with `BGWORKER_SHMEM_ACCESS`
- **Concurrency & Locking** (v0.6.0+): The rename/truncate step requires an `AccessExclusiveLock`. To prevent stalling the database if queries are actively holding shared read locks on the delta table, the merge worker uses a low `lock_timeout` and retry logic for the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` statement, ensuring concurrent `INSERT` and `SELECT` operations are not blocked entirely by a queued exclusive lock.
- **Fresh-table generation merge** (v0.6.0): each merge cycle creates a *new* `vp_{id}_main_new` table rather than inserting incrementally into the existing one (incremental inserts degrade BRIN effectiveness because BRIN requires physically sorted data):
  1. `CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.vp_{id}_main_new` (heap)
  2. `INSERT … SELECT … ORDER BY s FROM (SELECT * FROM vp_{id}_main EXCEPT SELECT * FROM vp_{id}_tombstones UNION ALL SELECT * FROM vp_{id}_delta)` — combines existing main (minus tombstones) with new delta rows; `ORDER BY s` on a freshly created heap produces physically sorted pages so BRIN works correctly without a separate `CLUSTER` step
  3. `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` to atomically replace the old main (catalog-only, zero query downtime since queries read `UNION ALL delta + main`)
  4. `TRUNCATE vp_{id}_delta, vp_{id}_tombstones` — clear delta and tombstones
  5. Old main retained for `pg_ripple.merge_retention_seconds` (GUC, default 60s) then `DROP TABLE`
- `pg_ripple.compact(keep_old BOOL DEFAULT false)` triggers an immediate full merge across all VP tables; `keep_old := false` drops previous generations immediately
- Updates BRIN summaries post-merge
- Runs `ANALYZE` on merged VP tables so the PostgreSQL planner has fresh selectivity estimates
- Triggers `pg_ripple.promote_rare_predicates()` for any rare predicates that crossed the promotion threshold
- Signals completion via shared-memory latch
- **Commit-hook early trigger**: a PostgreSQL `ProcessUtility` hook (or `ExecutorEnd` hook) detects when a write transaction commits more than `pg_ripple.latch_trigger_threshold` rows (default: 10,000) and pokes the merge worker's shared-memory latch immediately — avoiding the full polling interval wait for bursty workloads. Implemented as an `ExecutorEnd_hook` in `src/storage/merge.rs`.

**Query Path**:
- `(main EXCEPT tombstones) UNION ALL delta`, with bloom filter for fast existence checks
- When tombstones table is empty (common case between merges for insert-heavy workloads), simplifies to `UNION ALL` of main + delta
- For queries touching only historical data, the delta scan is skipped

#### 4.3.3 Bulk Loading

- Inline TEXT variants: `pg_ripple.load_turtle(data TEXT)`, `pg_ripple.load_ntriples(data TEXT)`, `pg_ripple.load_nquads(data TEXT)` (v0.2.0), `pg_ripple.load_trig(data TEXT)` (v0.2.0)
- File-path variants: `pg_ripple.load_turtle_file(path TEXT)`, `pg_ripple.load_ntriples_file(path TEXT)`, `pg_ripple.load_nquads_file(path TEXT)`, `pg_ripple.load_trig_file(path TEXT)` (v0.2.0) — read via `pg_read_file()` with superuser privilege check; essential for datasets exceeding the ~1 GB TEXT parameter limit
- Parses via `rio_turtle` / `rio_api` crates in streaming fashion; `oxttl` / `oxrdf` for RDF-star variants (v0.4.0+)
- Batches of 10,000 triples: dictionary-encode → `COPY` into VP tables (delta partition from v0.6.0+)
- Disables index updates during load; rebuilds at end
- Malformed RDF is caught in the `rio_turtle` / `rio_api` streaming parser layer before data reaches `COPY`; no PostgreSQL-level fault tolerance needed (note: `COPY ... REJECT_LIMIT` is a Greenplum/Cloudberry feature, not stock PostgreSQL; PG17+ offers `ON_ERROR ignore` but it is unnecessary here since parsing happens in Rust)
- Runs `ANALYZE` on affected VP tables after load completes (from v0.2.0; ensures PostgreSQL planner has accurate selectivity estimates)

#### 4.3.4 Subject Patterns (`_pg_ripple.subject_patterns`, v0.6.0)

Precomputed index mapping each subject to the sorted array of all its predicate IDs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.subject_patterns (
    s        BIGINT NOT NULL,
    pattern  BIGINT[] NOT NULL,  -- sorted array of predicate IDs for this subject
    PRIMARY KEY (s)
);
CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.subject_patterns USING GIN (pattern);
```

- **DESCRIBE queries**: look up `pattern` for the subject in one index seek, then query only the N VP tables in the array — O(N) instead of scanning all VP tables
- **Statistics**: `SELECT unnest(pattern), count(*) FROM subject_patterns GROUP BY 1` gives predicate-popularity counts without touching VP tables
- **GIN index**: enables "subjects that have both predicate P1 and P2" queries (`pattern @> ARRAY[$1, $2]`) efficiently
- Maintained by the merge worker after each generation merge, not on individual INSERTs

#### 4.3.5 Object Patterns (`_pg_ripple.object_patterns`, v0.6.0)

Precomputed index mapping each object to the sorted array of all its predicate IDs. This solves the "unbound object problem" for reverse-edge exploration.

```sql
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.object_patterns (
    o        BIGINT NOT NULL,
    pattern  BIGINT[] NOT NULL,  -- sorted array of predicate IDs for this object
    PRIMARY KEY (o)
);
CREATE INDEX ON _pg_ripple.object_patterns USING GIN (pattern);
```

- **Reverse DESCRIBE / Incoming Arcs**: Similar to `subject_patterns`, `object_patterns` intercepts scattergun reverse queries (`?s ?p <Object>`) in O(N) rather than forcing a catastrophic `UNION ALL` across all thousands of VP tables.
- Maintained by the merge worker after each generation merge.

#### 4.3.6 Deduplication (`src/storage/mod.rs`, v0.7.0)

RDF semantics permit a triple store to function as a *bag* (multiset) — the same `(s, p, o, g)` tuple may appear multiple times, each occurrence receiving a distinct statement identifier (SID). This is correct for provenance-tracking and RDF-star annotation use cases. However, many applications expect *set* semantics: each logical fact stored exactly once. Two mechanisms address this without modifying the insert path or affecting performance of normal writes:

**Option 1 — Explicit deduplication functions** (on-demand; zero insert-time overhead)

Exposed as `#[pg_extern]` functions in `src/lib.rs`, implemented in `src/storage/mod.rs`:

- `pg_ripple.deduplicate_predicate(p_iri TEXT) RETURNS BIGINT` — removes duplicate `(s, o, g)` rows for a single predicate, keeping the row with the lowest SID (oldest assertion). For `vp_{id}_delta` tables, uses `DELETE … WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT MIN(ctid) … GROUP BY s, o, g)`. For `vp_{id}_main` (read-only between merges), records all but the minimum-SID row in `vp_{id}_tombstones`, which masks duplicates at query time and removes them at the next merge. For `vp_rare`, uses the same `MIN(ctid) GROUP BY p, s, o, g` pattern. Returns total rows removed.
- `pg_ripple.deduplicate_all() RETURNS BIGINT` — applies `deduplicate_predicate` across all predicates; returns total rows removed across all VP tables and `vp_rare`.
- Both functions run `ANALYZE` on all modified tables after deduplication.

**Option 3 — HTAP merge-time deduplication** (background; `pg_ripple.dedup_on_merge` GUC, default `false`)

When enabled, the generation merge in `src/storage/merge.rs` replaces the plain accumulation with a deduplicating projection:

```sql
-- dedup_on_merge = false (default): plain merge
INSERT INTO vp_{id}_main_new
SELECT s, o, g, i, source
FROM (main − tombstones) UNION ALL delta
ORDER BY s;

-- dedup_on_merge = true: deduplicate during merge, keep lowest SID
INSERT INTO vp_{id}_main_new
SELECT DISTINCT ON (s, o, g) s, o, g, i, source
FROM (main − tombstones) UNION ALL delta
ORDER BY s, o, g, i ASC;
```

Semantics and constraints:
- `DISTINCT ON (s, o, g) ORDER BY … i ASC` retains the globally-lowest SID for each logical triple.
- After a merge, `_main` contains at most one row per `(s, o, g, named-graph)` tuple.
- Between merges, the delta partition may temporarily hold duplicates; queries through the `(main EXCEPT tombstones) UNION ALL delta` view are not guaranteed duplicate-free until the next merge cycle fires.
- SIDs of eliminated duplicate rows are **not** preserved. If RDF-star annotations exist on those SIDs in other VP tables, those annotations become orphaned (`vacuum_dictionary()` will not remove them since their IDs may still appear in the orphaned statement rows). For provenance-heavy workloads, use Option 1 instead.

### 4.4 SPARQL Query Engine (`src/sparql/`)

**Purpose**: Parse SPARQL, translate to optimized SQL, execute, decode results.

#### 4.4.1 Pipeline

#### 4.4.2 SQL Functions

```sql

-- Maintenance
pg_ripple.vacuum_dictionary() RETURNS BIGINT  -- removes unreferenced dictionary entries; safe to run any time
pg_ripple.compact(keep_old BOOL DEFAULT false) RETURNS VOID  -- trigger immediate full generation merge
```

#### 4.4.3 Join Optimization Strategies

Optimizations fall into two categories: **structural rewrites** that are applied by the algebra optimizer during SPARQL→SQL translation (low overhead, no statistics required, active from v0.3.0) and **statistics-driven rewrites** that read PostgreSQL planner statistics at plan time (introduced in v0.13.0 — Performance Hardening). Benchmarking infrastructure (BSBM, SP2Bench, fuzz testing) is built in v0.5.0+ and exercised in v0.6.0 (HTAP concurrent workload) and v0.13.0 to measure optimization effectiveness and validate performance targets.

**Structural rewrites (v0.3.0+)**:
1. **Self-join elimination**: Star patterns on the same subject collapse into a single scan of the subject across multiple VP tables, joined by subject ID equality
2. **Optional-self-join elimination**: OPTIONAL → INNER JOIN only when the optimizer can prove the rewrite preserves query semantics for the actual focus-node domain; SHACL metadata can contribute evidence but is not sufficient on its own
3. **Self-union elimination**: Multiple triple patterns binding the same variable to different predicates are rewritten to `WHERE predicate_id IN (...)`
4. **Projection pushing**: `SELECT DISTINCT ?p` queries enumerate the `_pg_ripple.predicates` catalog instead of scanning all VP tables
5. **Filter pushdown**: SPARQL `FILTER` clauses operating on bound IRIs are resolved to integer IDs *before* generating SQL, ensuring B-tree index usage. From v0.5.1, typed numeric/date literals use the inline-encoded i64 range (see §4.2.2) to enable `BETWEEN $lo AND $hi` range scans with no decode step. Prior to v0.5.1, FILTER comparisons on typed literals use a dictionary-join decode approach.
6. **Merge-join enablement**: When the join variable matches the `s` sort key of a VP table's `(s, o, g)` primary index, the emitter wraps the CTE in `ORDER BY s`. The PostgreSQL planner then considers a merge join rather than a hash join, reducing memory pressure for large intermediate results.

**Plan caching (v0.3.0+)**:

SPI re-parses and re-plans the generated SQL string on every query invocation. The SPARQL-layer plan cache avoids this overhead for structurally identical queries by caching the SPARQL→SQL translation result keyed on a structural hash of the normalized algebra tree (variable names replaced with position indices). Controlled by `pg_ripple.plan_cache_size` GUC (default: 256; 0 = disabled). This is introduced in v0.3.0 — before the performance milestone — because re-translation overhead is observable from the first SPARQL-capable release. Additional optimization work (prepared statements, PostgreSQL plan caching instrumentation) remains v0.13.0 work. Benchmarked via BSBM from v0.5.0 onward.

**Statistics-driven rewrites (v0.13.0+)**:
7. **BGP join reordering**: The algebra optimizer reads `pg_stats.n_distinct` and `pg_class.reltuples` for each VP table involved in the query and reorders BGPs cheapest-first (most selective predicate scanned first). Only activated when statistics are available; falls back to source order otherwise. When active, emits `SET LOCAL join_collapse_limit = 1` before the generated SQL to lock the PostgreSQL planner into the computed join order, preventing it from re-ordering the already-optimized sequence.
8. **Optimizer Robustness / Fallback**: Because deriving perfect selectivity from `pg_stats.n_distinct` is fragile over multi-way self-joins, the Rust-based optimizer implements dynamic sampling or uses fallback heuristic costs (e.g. reverting to native PostgreSQL planning) if `pg_stats` suggests high cardinality uncertainty. This prevents forcing PostgreSQL into highly suboptimal plans.
9. **Join-order hints**: A `<http://pg-ripple.io/hints/join-order>` pragma in the SPARQL prologue overrides statistics-driven ordering by emitting `SET LOCAL join_collapse_limit = 1` with the user-specified BGP order.
10. **`no-inference` hint**: Adding `hint:no-inference true` to the query prologue appends `AND source = 0` on every VP table scan, restricting results to explicitly asserted triples only (v0.10.0+).

#### 4.4.4 Property Path Compilation

SPARQL property paths (`+`, `*`, `?`) compile to `WITH RECURSIVE` CTEs with PG18's `CYCLE` clause for hash-based cycle detection:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE path(s, o, depth) AS (
    -- Anchor: direct one-hop
    SELECT s, o, 1
    FROM _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id}
    WHERE s = $1
  UNION ALL
    -- Recursive: extend by one hop
    SELECT p.s, vp.o, p.depth + 1
    FROM path p
    JOIN _pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id} vp ON p.o = vp.s
    WHERE p.depth < pg_ripple.max_path_depth
)
CYCLE o SET is_cycle USING cycle_path
SELECT DISTINCT s, o FROM path WHERE NOT is_cycle;
```

- Configurable `pg_ripple.max_path_depth` GUC (default: 100)
- PG18 `CYCLE` clause for hash-based cycle detection (replaces array-based visited tracking — $O(1)$ membership checks instead of $O(n)$ array scans)
- PG18's improved CTE performance benefits recursive path queries
- **Performance constraint**: PostgreSQL materializes each level of a `WITH RECURSIVE` CTE into a work-table before proceeding to the next. For deep traversals (depth > ~5-10 hops) or wide fan-out on large graphs, the per-level materialization cost dominates and can cause execution times to degrade exponentially. The <100 ms benchmark target (§13) applies to bounded-depth paths (depth ≤ 10) on typical RDF datasets; unbounded paths on dense graphs will inherently bottleneck the PG execution planner. Mitigation: `max_path_depth` GUC, `statement_timeout`, and the resource-exhaustion test suite in v0.5.0.

### 4.5 Named Graph Support (`src/graph/`)

- The `g` column in VP tables stores the named graph dictionary ID
- `g = 0` represents the default graph
- SPARQL `GRAPH ?g { ... }` and `FROM NAMED <uri>` map to `WHERE g = encode(uri)` filters
- Graph management functions:
  - `pg_ripple.create_graph(uri TEXT)`
  - `pg_ripple.drop_graph(uri TEXT)`
  - `pg_ripple.list_graphs() RETURNS SETOF TEXT`

> **Post-1.0 consideration — graph-partitioned VP tables**: For workloads where `DROP GRAPH` is frequent and graphs are large, consider adding optional PostgreSQL range- or list-partitioning on the `g` column of individual VP tables. A graph drop would then become a DDL `DETACH PARTITION; DROP TABLE` operation, completely bypassing the `DELETE + VACUUM` overhead that the current `(g, p, s, o)` index-driven bulk delete incurs. This adds schema complexity and is only worthwhile when graphs are large and short-lived (e.g., named-graph-per-document load patterns). Revisit during v0.12.0 planning.

### 4.6 SHACL Validation Engine (`src/shacl/`)

**Purpose**: Enforce data integrity constraints defined in SHACL shapes.

#### 4.6.1 Exact SHACL Semantics

SHACL support is **spec-first**: loaded shapes are parsed into a shape IR that preserves W3C SHACL semantics, and validation is executed against that IR. PostgreSQL constraints, triggers, helper tables, or stream tables may be used as **internal accelerators only when they are proven semantics-preserving for the specific shape pattern**; they are never the normative definition of constraint behavior.

Validation is compiled to per-shape validator plans over focus nodes and value nodes:

| SHACL Constraint | Validation Strategy |
|---|---|
| `sh:minCount` | Count matching value nodes per focus node and compare against the required minimum |
| `sh:maxCount` | Count matching value nodes per focus node and compare against the allowed maximum |
| `sh:datatype` | Validate RDF term kind and datatype IRI exactly against dictionary metadata / inline encoding |
| `sh:in (...)` | Validate RDF-term equality against the allowed value set |
| `sh:pattern` | Apply SHACL regex semantics to the lexical form of the value node |
| `sh:class` | Evaluate required `rdf:type` membership for each value node |
| `sh:node` / `sh:property` | Recurse into nested shapes using the same validator pipeline |
| `sh:or` / `sh:and` / `sh:not` / qualified constraints | Evaluate via composed validator plans (v0.8.0+) |

Examples of **allowed internal accelerators** when exactness is preserved:
- An index on `(s, g)` to speed up `sh:maxCount 1` counting
- A cached target-node set for `sh:targetClass`
- A trigger that short-circuits obvious violations but still falls back to the full validator when needed

Examples of **disallowed semantic shortcuts**:
- Treating `sh:minCount 1` as a bare `NOT NULL` on a VP row
- Treating `sh:maxCount 1` as a table-wide `UNIQUE` index without proving the same focus-node and path semantics as the SHACL shape

#### 4.6.2 Asynchronous Validation Pipeline

For bulk loads where synchronous validation is too expensive:

1. Lightweight trigger captures inserted triple IDs into `_pg_ripple.validation_queue`
2. Background worker (pgrx `BackgroundWorker`) processes queued triples against loaded SHACL shapes
3. Invalid triples moved to `_pg_ripple.dead_letter_queue` with violation report (as JSONB)
4. Valid triples remain in the VP tables

#### 4.6.3 Query Optimization via SHACL

The SPARQL→SQL translator reads loaded SHACL shapes:
- Shape metadata may inform **costing** and may enable **semantics-preserving rewrites** when the proof obligation is satisfied for the exact query domain
- `sh:maxCount 1` may enable cardinality-sensitive optimizations only when the query is provably restricted to the same focus-node population as the validated shape
- `sh:class` / `sh:targetClass` may support type-based pruning only when the query's variable domain is provably identical to the shape target set
- The presence of a shape alone is never sufficient to rewrite query semantics; unsafe rewrites are disabled by default

### 4.7 Serialization & Export (`src/export/`)

- `pg_ripple.export_turtle(graph TEXT DEFAULT NULL) RETURNS TEXT`
- `pg_ripple.export_ntriples(graph TEXT DEFAULT NULL) RETURNS TEXT`
- `pg_ripple.export_jsonld(graph TEXT DEFAULT NULL) RETURNS JSONB`
- Streaming output via `RETURNS SETOF TEXT` for large graphs

### 4.8 Statistics & Monitoring (`src/stats/`)

- `pg_ripple.stats() RETURNS JSONB` — triple count, predicate distribution, dictionary size, cache hit ratio, delta/main partition sizes
- Integration with `pg_stat_statements` for SPARQL query tracking
- Custom `EXPLAIN` option (PG18 feature) to annotate SPARQL→SQL translations
- **When pg_trickle is available**: `stats()` reads from `_pg_ripple.predicate_stats` and `_pg_ripple.graph_stats` stream tables (instant, no full scan) instead of re-scanning VP tables on every call. See §4.10.

### 4.9 Administrative Functions (`src/admin/`)

- `pg_ripple.vacuum()` — force delta→main merge
- `pg_ripple.compact(keep_old BOOL DEFAULT false)` — immediate full generation merge across all VP tables; `keep_old := false` drops previous main-table generations immediately
- `pg_ripple.vacuum_dictionary() RETURNS BIGINT` — removes dictionary entries not referenced by any VP table column; returns count of removed entries
- `pg_ripple.reindex()` — rebuild VP table indices
- `pg_ripple.dictionary_stats()` — cache hit ratio, dictionary sizes
- `pg_ripple.register_prefix(prefix TEXT, expansion TEXT)` — IRI prefix registration
- `pg_ripple.prefixes() RETURNS TABLE(prefix TEXT, expansion TEXT)`
- `pg_ripple.deduplicate_predicate(p_iri TEXT) RETURNS BIGINT` — (v0.7.0) remove duplicate `(s, o, g)` rows for one predicate, keeping the lowest-SID row; runs `ANALYZE` afterward; returns count of rows removed
- `pg_ripple.deduplicate_all() RETURNS BIGINT` — (v0.7.0) deduplicate all predicates across dedicated VP tables and `vp_rare`; returns total rows removed

### 4.10 Ecosystem: pg_trickle Integration (`src/ecosystem/`)

**Purpose**: Optional reactivity layer powered by [pg_trickle](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-trickle) stream tables. All features in this module require pg_trickle to be installed; core pg_ripple functionality works without it. See [full analysis](ecosystem/pg_trickle.md).

#### 4.10.1 Runtime Detection

```rust
fn has_pg_trickle() -> bool {
    Spi::get_one::<bool>(
        "SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trickle')"
    ).unwrap_or(Some(false)).unwrap_or(false)
}
```

All stream-table features gate on this check. Functions that require pg_trickle return a clear error with install instructions when it is absent.

#### 4.10.2 Live Statistics (Stream Tables)

When pg_trickle is detected, `pg_ripple.enable_live_statistics()` creates stream tables:

- `_pg_ripple.predicate_stats` — per-predicate triple count, distinct subjects/objects (refreshed every 5s)
- `_pg_ripple.graph_stats` — per-graph triple count (refreshed every 10s)

`pg_ripple.stats()` reads from these stream tables instead of full-scanning VP tables — 100–1000× faster.

#### 4.10.3 SHACL Violation Monitors

Simple SHACL constraints (cardinality, datatype, class) can be modeled as stream tables with `IMMEDIATE` refresh mode, validating within the same transaction as the DML:

- `sh:minCount` violations → `NOT EXISTS` stream table
- `sh:datatype` violations → filtered join stream table
- Multiple shapes → pg_trickle's DAG scheduler handles refresh ordering

Complex shapes (`sh:or`, `sh:and`, multi-hop) still use the procedural validation pipeline from §4.6.

#### 4.10.4 Inference Materialization (→ Datalog Engine)

> **Note**: This section is superseded by the general Datalog reasoning engine. See [plans/ecosystem/datalog.md](plans/ecosystem/datalog.md) for the full design.

The original plan — `pg_ripple.enable_inference_materialization()` creating hard-coded `WITH RECURSIVE` stream tables for `rdfs:subClassOf` and `rdfs:subPropertyOf` — is replaced by a general-purpose Datalog engine that:

- Parses user-defined and built-in rules (RDFS, OWL RL) in a Turtle-flavoured Datalog syntax
- Stratifies rules to handle negation-as-failure correctly
- Compiles each stratum to SQL: non-recursive → `INSERT … SELECT`, recursive → `WITH RECURSIVE … CYCLE`, negation → `NOT EXISTS`
- Materializes derived predicates as pg_trickle stream tables (recommended) or inlines them as CTEs at query time (on-demand, no pg_trickle needed)
- Registers derived VP tables in `_pg_ripple.predicates` so the SPARQL engine treats them identically to base VP tables
- Multi-head rules: each head atom may target a different predicate and carry an optional named graph ID
- **Incremental materialization phases** (inspired by RDFox): each materialization cycle runs three phases in order:
  1. *Addition* — derive and insert new triples produced by rules applied to newly asserted facts; write with `source = 1`
  2. *Deletion* — identify derived triples whose support has been retracted; remove them from VP tables
  3. *BwdChain* — re-derive any derived triple that was deleted but is still entailed by surviving facts (avoids over-deletion)
- **Rule set catalog**: `_pg_ripple.rule_sets (name TEXT, graph_ids BIGINT[], rule_hash BIGINT)` stores named rule sets. `rule_hash` is the XXH3-64 hash of the canonicalized rule text; the materialization worker skips re-computation when the hash is unchanged. Rule set caches are keyed on this hash so a re-activated rule set resumes from its previous derived state.
- **Named rule sets**: `pg_ripple.load_rules(name TEXT, rules TEXT)` registers a rule set; `pg_ripple.enable_rule_set(name TEXT)` activates it for a given set of named graphs.

#### 4.10.5 SPARQL Views

```sql
pg_ripple.create_sparql_view(
    name     TEXT,
    sparql   TEXT,
    schedule TEXT DEFAULT '5s'
) RETURNS VOID
```

Parses SPARQL → generates SQL → creates a pg_trickle stream table. The result is an always-fresh materialized SPARQL query: multi-join VP table scans + dictionary decoding happen once during materialization, and queries become simple table scans.

#### 4.10.5.1 Datalog Views

```sql
pg_ripple.create_datalog_view(
    name     TEXT,
    rules    TEXT DEFAULT NULL,     -- inline Datalog rules (NULL when using rule_set)
    rule_set TEXT DEFAULT NULL,     -- reference a loaded rule set by name
    goal     TEXT,                  -- goal pattern: '?x ex:indirectManager ex:Alice .'
    schedule TEXT DEFAULT '10s',
    decode   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
) RETURNS VOID
```

Bundles a Datalog rule set with a goal pattern into a single pg_trickle stream table. The existing rule parser, stratifier, and SQL compiler (§4.10.4) produce the recursive CTE; the goal pattern's bound constants are dictionary-encoded and pushed into a `WHERE` clause on the outermost `SELECT`. Unbound goal variables become named columns in the stream table. See [plans/ecosystem/datalog.md § 15](plans/ecosystem/datalog.md) for the full design.

Constraint rules (empty-head) work as a special case: the body variables become projected columns and any row in the stream table represents a violation. `IMMEDIATE` mode catches violations within the same transaction.

#### 4.10.6 ExtVP (Extended Vertical Partitioning)

Pre-computed semi-joins between frequently co-joined predicates, implemented as stream tables. The SPARQL→SQL translator rewrites queries to target ExtVP tables when available. Initially manual via `create_sparql_view()`; automated workload-driven creation is a post-1.0 goal.

> **`shared_memory_size` vs `cache_budget`**: `shared_memory_size` is a *startup* GUC that declares the total shared memory block to PostgreSQL at postmaster start — it cannot be changed without a restart. `cache_budget` is a *runtime* cap that controls how much of that pre-allocated block pg_ripple is allowed to use. Setting `cache_budget > shared_memory_size` is an error caught at `_PG_init`.

## 4.12 JSON-LD Framing Engine (`src/framing/`)

**Introduced**: v0.17.0  
**Purpose**: Translate a W3C JSON-LD 1.1 frame document into a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query, execute it via the existing SPARQL engine, and reshape the flat result into a nested JSON-LD tree.

### Design rationale

The naïve framing approach (used in option 1 considered during design) exports the entire RDF graph as flat JSON-LD, then feeds it to a general-purpose framing library. This is correct but expensive: a frame targeting 3 predicates on a graph with 10,000 predicates still forces a full scan of all VP tables.

The frame-driven SPARQL approach (option 2, implemented here) instead translates the frame's structural constraints directly into a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query at the start. PostgreSQL then reads only the VP tables touched by the frame's join tree. For a frame that selects `ex:Company` nodes with their `ex:name` and `ex:employee` relations, only 3 VP table scans occur regardless of total graph size. Framed output is a natural consequence of the CONSTRUCT result shape — no external crate is needed.

The `jsonld_frame_to_sparql()` SQL function exposes the intermediate CONSTRUCT query, making the translation debuggable and allowing users to copy, modify, and re-execute the generated SPARQL independently.

### Module layout

```
src/framing/
  mod.rs              — public entry point: frame(input_frame, graph, options) → serde_json::Value
  frame_translator.rs — JSON-LD frame → spargebra CONSTRUCT algebra tree
  embedder.rs         — flat CONSTRUCT rows → nested JSON-LD tree (W3C §4.1 algorithm)
  compactor.rs        — @context prefix substitution on the output tree
```

### 4.12.1 Frame Translation (`frame_translator.rs`)

The translator walks the frame JSON tree recursively and builds a `spargebra::algebra::GraphPattern` (CONSTRUCT form).

**Input**: a `serde_json::Value` that is a valid JSON-LD frame object.  
**Output**: a `spargebra::Query::Construct` with a WHERE clause and a CONSTRUCT template.

**Mapping rules**:

| Frame construct | Generated SPARQL |
|---|---|
| `"@type": "ex:Foo"` | `?s a <http://example.org/Foo>` in WHERE (inner join — type is mandatory for matching) |
| `"@type": ["ex:A","ex:B"]` | `?s a ?_t . FILTER(?_t IN (<A>, <B>))` |
| `"ex:prop": {}` | `OPTIONAL { ?s <ex:prop> ?_v0 }` |
| `"ex:prop": []` | `OPTIONAL { ?s <ex:prop> ?_absent0 } FILTER(!bound(?_absent0))` |
| `"ex:prop": { ... nested frame ... }` | `OPTIONAL { ?s <ex:prop> ?_n0 . ... recursive patterns for ?_n0 ... }` |
| `"@reverse": { "ex:memberOf": { ... } }` | `OPTIONAL { ?_r0 <ex:memberOf> ?s . ... patterns for ?_r0 ... }` |
| `"@id": "http://ex.org/Alice"` | `FILTER(?s = <http://ex.org/Alice>)` |
| `"@id": ["http://ex.org/A", "http://ex.org/B"]` | `FILTER(?s IN (<A>, <B>))` |
| `"@requireAll": true` on a frame object | Converts all `OPTIONAL` joins to inner joins within that frame object's scope |

All IRI values are dictionary-encoded to `i64` before SQL generation — the resulting JOIN conditions are integer equality on VP table `s`/`o` columns, never string comparisons.

Variable names are generated as `?_v{depth}_{index}` to avoid collisions across recursion levels. The CONSTRUCT template mirrors the WHERE clause variable bindings.

### 4.12.2 Tree-Embedding Algorithm (`embedder.rs`)

The embedder implements the W3C JSON-LD 1.1 Framing §4.1 algorithm, operating on the flat CONSTRUCT result set already in hand (not on a generic JSON-LD document from an external source).

**Input**:
- A list of `(subject_nt, predicate_nt, object_nt)` triple rows from the SPARQL engine (decoded N-Triples strings)
- The original frame `serde_json::Value`
- `embed`, `explicit`, `omit_default`, `ordered` option flags

**Algorithm**:
1. Build a **subject node map** (`HashMap<String, BTreeMap<String, Vec<Value>>>`) from the triple rows — keyed by subject N-Triples string, mapping predicate to list of object values converted via `nt_term_to_jsonld_value`
2. Walk the frame tree recursively. For each frame level:
   a. Collect subjects that match the frame's `@type` / `@id` / property constraints
   b. For each matched subject, build an output node object:
      - If `@embed = @once`: embed the node here and record it as embedded; subsequent occurrences of the same subject in other property positions emit `{"@id": "..."}` references only
      - If `@embed = @always`: embed unconditionally (risk of circular output if the data is cyclic)
      - If `@embed = @never`: always emit `{"@id": "..."}` reference
   c. For each property in the output node, recurse into the frame's nested object for that property to embed child nodes
   d. Apply `@explicit`: if `true`, omit output properties not listed in the frame
   e. Apply `@default` / `@omitDefault`: for properties present in the frame but absent in the data, either include `{"@value": null}` or omit entirely
   f. Apply `@reverse`: collect subjects from the node map whose specified predicate points to the current subject, and embed them under the reverse key
3. Collect root-level matched nodes into the output array
4. If result contains exactly one root node and `@omitGraph` is `true` (default for JSON-LD 1.1 mode), return the node directly without a `@graph` wrapper; otherwise wrap in `{"@context": ..., "@graph": [...]}`

The embedder reuses `nt_term_to_jsonld_value` from `src/export.rs` for consistent N-Triples-to-JSON-LD value conversion.

### 4.12.3 Compaction (`compactor.rs`)

A lightweight prefix-substitution pass applied after embedding. No full JSON-LD compaction algorithm is implemented (that would require the `json-ld` crate); instead:

1. Extract all `prefix → IRI` mappings from the frame's `@context` block
2. Walk the output JSON tree and replace full IRI strings with their shortest matching compact form (e.g. `"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"` → `"foaf:name"`)
3. For `@id` values and `@type` values, apply compaction
4. Inject the `@context` object from the frame as the first key of the output document

This covers the overwhelming majority of real-world compaction needs without a full round-trip through the JSON-LD algorithm suite.

### 4.12.4 SQL Function Signatures

```sql
-- Translate a frame to a SPARQL CONSTRUCT string (for debugging and inspection).
pg_ripple.jsonld_frame_to_sparql(
    frame   JSONB,
    graph   TEXT    DEFAULT NULL   -- NULL = merged graph; IRI = restrict to named graph
) RETURNS TEXT

-- Primary end-user function: frame-driven fetch + embedding + compaction.
pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed(
    frame     JSONB,
    graph     TEXT    DEFAULT NULL,
    embed     TEXT    DEFAULT '@once',   -- @once | @always | @never
    explicit  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,     -- explicit inclusion flag
    ordered   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE      -- lexicographic ordering of output keys
) RETURNS JSONB

-- Streaming variant — one NDJSON line per matched root node.
pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed_stream(
    frame   JSONB,
    graph   TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS SETOF TEXT

-- General-purpose primitive — frame any existing expanded JSON-LD JSONB.
pg_ripple.jsonld_frame(
    input     JSONB,
    frame     JSONB,
    embed     TEXT    DEFAULT '@once',
    explicit  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    ordered   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
) RETURNS JSONB
```

### 4.12.5 Plan Cache Integration

`export_jsonld_framed()` calls `jsonld_frame_to_sparql()` internally to produce the CONSTRUCT query string, then passes it through the existing `src/sparql/plan_cache.rs` translation cache using the CONSTRUCT string as the cache key. The embedding and compaction steps are not cached (they depend on the live data). Repeated calls with the same frame and graph skip SPARQL→SQL retranslation.

### 4.12.6 Error Codes

New `PT700`-range codes assigned for framing errors (within the existing Serialization / export range):

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `PT710` | Frame is not a JSON object |
| `PT711` | Unrecognised `@embed` value |
| `PT712` | Frame nesting depth exceeds `pg_ripple.max_path_depth` |
| `PT713` | Frame `@context` is malformed |

### 4.12.7 Framing Views (`create_framing_view`) *(requires pg_trickle)*

**Introduced**: v0.17.0  
**Dependency**: pg_trickle (soft — detected at call time via `pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available()`).

Framing views extend the `create_sparql_view` pattern from §4.10 (v0.11.0) to JSON-LD framing. The frame is translated to a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query by `frame_translator.rs`; that CONSTRUCT string becomes the SQL definition of a pg_trickle stream table. Incremental refresh means that when triples are inserted or deleted, only the VP tables referenced in the CONSTRUCT query are rescanned — not the whole graph.

**Catalog table** (`_pg_ripple.framing_views`):

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `TEXT` PRIMARY KEY | User-assigned view name |
| `frame` | `JSONB` | Original frame document |
| `generated_construct` | `TEXT` | SPARQL CONSTRUCT string from `frame_translator` |
| `schedule` | `TEXT` | pg_trickle refresh schedule |
| `output_format` | `TEXT` | `'jsonld'`, `'ndjson'`, `'turtle'` |
| `decode` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether IRI-decoding view is created |
| `stream_table_oid` | `OID` | OID of the pg_trickle stream table |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Creation timestamp |

**Stream table schema** (auto-created as `pg_ripple.framing_view_{name}`):

```
subject_id   BIGINT       -- dictionary-encoded subject IRI (integer ID)
frame_tree   JSONB        -- fully embedded + compacted frame output for this root node
refreshed_at TIMESTAMPTZ  DEFAULT now()
```

When `decode = TRUE`, a thin decoding view `pg_ripple.framing_view_{name}_decoded` is additionally created. It calls `pg_ripple.decode_iri(subject_id)` to surface the `@id` value as a human-readable IRI string and expands the `frame_tree` JSONB inline. The stream table itself always stores integer IDs to minimise CDC surface area.

**Refresh mode selection heuristics** (mirrors `create_sparql_view`):

| Refresh mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| `IMMEDIATE` | Constraint-style frames: any matched root node in the view is a violation (e.g. select `ex:Company` nodes that lack `ex:complianceOfficer`). Fires within the same transaction as the DML. |
| `DIFFERENTIAL` + schedule | Dashboard / API use cases: only changed subjects are reprocessed on each tick. Suitable for a company directory refreshed every 10 s. |
| `FULL` + long schedule | Large full-graph framed exports intended for data warehouses or downstream consumers. Safe for frames with deep nesting or `@always` embedding. |

**SQL function signatures**:

```sql
-- Create an incrementally-maintained framing view (requires pg_trickle).
pg_ripple.create_framing_view(
    name          TEXT,
    frame         JSONB,
    schedule      TEXT    DEFAULT '5s',
    decode        BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    output_format TEXT    DEFAULT 'jsonld'
) RETURNS void

-- Drop the stream table and catalog entry.
pg_ripple.drop_framing_view(name TEXT) RETURNS void

-- List all active framing views.
pg_ripple.list_framing_views() RETURNS TABLE(
    name             TEXT,
    frame            JSONB,
    schedule         TEXT,
    output_format    TEXT,
    decode           BOOLEAN,
    row_count        BIGINT,
    last_refresh     TIMESTAMPTZ,
    stream_table_oid OID
)
```

**pg_trickle detection**: `create_framing_view()` calls `pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available()` as its first step and raises `ERROR: pg_trickle is required for framing views — install pg_trickle and add it to shared_preload_libraries, then retry` if absent. The error is raised at call time only; extension load never fails due to a missing pg_trickle.

**Relationship to `create_sparql_view`**: Both functions internally produce a CONSTRUCT or SELECT query string, register it with pg_trickle's stream table machinery, and record the metadata in a `_pg_ripple.*_views` catalog table. The key difference is that `create_framing_view` applies the full embedding + compaction pipeline over the CONSTRUCT results before storing each row, so the stream table contains ready-to-serve nested JSON-LD rather than flat projection rows.

## 4.13 SPARQL CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE & ASK Views (`src/views.rs`)

**Introduced**: v0.18.0  
**Depends on**: v0.5.1 CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE SQL generation; v0.11.0 stream-table registration machinery  
**Soft-requires**: pg_trickle (same availability check as v0.11.0)

### Overview

v0.11.0 restricts `create_sparql_view()` to SELECT queries because the SQL output of CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE/ASK has a different shape than a SELECT projection. v0.18.0 adds three dedicated functions — `create_construct_view`, `create_describe_view`, and `create_ask_view` — that handle the respective algebra variants and register pg_trickle stream tables with appropriate schemas.

### CONSTRUCT Views

**SQL generation** (`src/views.rs` → `compile_construct_for_view`):

1. Parse the query as `spargebra::Query::Construct { template, pattern, .. }`.
2. Compile `pattern` via the existing `sqlgen::translate_select` pipeline to produce an inner CTE `_inner`.
3. For each triple `(s_term, p_term, o_term)` in `template`, emit a SQL row expression:
   - Variables → reference the corresponding `_inner.{varname}` column.
   - IRI/literal constants → dictionary-encoded at view-creation time to their `BIGINT` ID; no string operations at refresh time.
   - Named-graph template triples include a `g` expression; default-graph triples emit `0 AS g`.
4. Combine all row expressions with `UNION ALL` to produce a flat `SELECT s, p, o, g` result set.

**Unbound variable check**: If any variable in the template does not appear in the WHERE pattern's projected variables, `compile_construct_for_view` returns an error listing the unbound names — caught at view-creation time, not at refresh time.

**Blank node rejection**: Blank nodes in a CONSTRUCT template cannot be assigned stable `BIGINT` IDs across refresh cycles. The compiler rejects them with a clear error advising skolemisation.

**Stream table schema**:

```sql
pg_ripple.construct_view_{name}(
    s  BIGINT NOT NULL,
    p  BIGINT NOT NULL,
    o  BIGINT NOT NULL,
    g  BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
)
```

When `decode = TRUE`, a thin decoding view is also created:

```sql
CREATE VIEW pg_ripple.construct_view_{name}_decoded AS
SELECT
    (SELECT value FROM _pg_ripple.dictionary WHERE id = s) AS s,
    (SELECT value FROM _pg_ripple.dictionary WHERE id = p) AS p,
    (SELECT value FROM _pg_ripple.dictionary WHERE id = o) AS o,
    (SELECT value FROM _pg_ripple.dictionary WHERE id = g) AS g
FROM pg_ripple.construct_view_{name};
```

**Catalog table** (`_pg_ripple.construct_views`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE _pg_ripple.construct_views (
    name           TEXT        NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    sparql         TEXT        NOT NULL,
    generated_sql  TEXT        NOT NULL,
    schedule       TEXT        NOT NULL,
    decode         BOOLEAN     NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    template_count BIGINT      NOT NULL,
    stream_table   TEXT        NOT NULL,
    created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### DESCRIBE Views

DESCRIBE resolves to a set of triples about the described resources. The SQL generation reuses the existing `describe_strategy` GUC logic from v0.5.1:

- `cbd` (Concise Bounded Description, default): `SELECT s, p, o, g FROM <all VP tables> WHERE s = <encoded_resource>` for each resource in the result set.
- `symmetric_cbd`: additionally includes triples where the resource appears as object.

Stream table schema is identical to CONSTRUCT views: `(s BIGINT, p BIGINT, o BIGINT, g BIGINT)`. Catalog table: `_pg_ripple.describe_views`.

### ASK Views

ASK compiles to a `SELECT EXISTS(...)` SQL expression. The stream table contains a single row:

```sql
pg_ripple.ask_view_{name}(
    result       BOOLEAN     NOT NULL,
    evaluated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
)
```

pg_trickle replaces the row on each refresh cycle. Because ASK is a scalar, refresh mode is always `IMMEDIATE` — the result is re-evaluated in-transaction on every write that touches a VP table referenced by the WHERE pattern.

Catalog table: `_pg_ripple.ask_views`.

### Public SQL API

```sql
-- CONSTRUCT views
pg_ripple.create_construct_view(
    name     TEXT,
    sparql   TEXT,
    schedule TEXT    DEFAULT '1s',
    decode   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
) RETURNS BIGINT  -- template triple count

pg_ripple.drop_construct_view(name TEXT) RETURNS void

pg_ripple.list_construct_views() RETURNS TABLE(
    name           TEXT,
    sparql         TEXT,
    generated_sql  TEXT,
    schedule       TEXT,
    decode         BOOLEAN,
    template_count BIGINT,
    stream_table   TEXT,
    created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ
)

-- DESCRIBE views
pg_ripple.create_describe_view(
    name     TEXT,
    sparql   TEXT,
    schedule TEXT    DEFAULT '1s',
    decode   BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
) RETURNS void

pg_ripple.drop_describe_view(name TEXT) RETURNS void

pg_ripple.list_describe_views() RETURNS TABLE(
    name          TEXT,
    sparql        TEXT,
    generated_sql TEXT,
    schedule      TEXT,
    decode        BOOLEAN,
    stream_table  TEXT,
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ
)

-- ASK views
pg_ripple.create_ask_view(
    name     TEXT,
    sparql   TEXT,
    schedule TEXT DEFAULT '1s'
) RETURNS void

pg_ripple.drop_ask_view(name TEXT) RETURNS void

pg_ripple.list_ask_views() RETURNS TABLE(
    name          TEXT,
    sparql        TEXT,
    generated_sql TEXT,
    schedule      TEXT,
    stream_table  TEXT,
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

All nine functions call `pg_trickle_available()` as their first step and raise an error with the standard install hint when pg_trickle is absent. Extension load never fails due to a missing pg_trickle.

### Relationship to Other View Types

| View type | Query form | Stream table schema | Decode view? |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| `create_sparql_view` (v0.11.0) | SELECT | `(varname BIGINT, ...)` — one col per variable | Yes |
| `create_construct_view` (v0.18.0) | CONSTRUCT | `(s, p, o, g BIGINT)` | Yes |
| `create_describe_view` (v0.18.0) | DESCRIBE | `(s, p, o, g BIGINT)` | Yes |
| `create_ask_view` (v0.18.0) | ASK | `(result BOOLEAN, evaluated_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` | No |
| `create_framing_view` (v0.17.0) | CONSTRUCT (via frame) | `(subject_id BIGINT, frame_tree JSONB, refreshed_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` | Yes (IRI decode only) |

## 4.14 Federation Performance Optimizations (`src/sparql/federation.rs`)

**Introduced**: v0.19.0

This section covers the performance layer built on top of the v0.16.0 federation executor. All optimizations are backward-compatible: the public API is unchanged and all new behaviour is gated on GUCs that default to their conservative (pre-0.19.0-equivalent) values.

### Connection Pooling

The v0.16.0 executor calls `ureq::AgentBuilder::new()` on every SERVICE invocation, creating a fresh HTTP client with no connection reuse. v0.19.0 replaces this with a backend-local shared agent stored in `thread_local! { static AGENT: OnceCell<ureq::Agent> }`. The agent is initialized once per backend on first use and reused for all subsequent SERVICE calls within the session, preserving TCP and TLS sessions.

`pg_ripple.federation_pool_size` (INT, default: 4) controls the maximum number of idle connections kept per host. The value is passed to `ureq::AgentBuilder::max_idle_connections_per_host()`.

### Result Caching

Caching is disabled by default (`pg_ripple.federation_cache_ttl = 0`). When enabled, the executor computes `XXH3-64(sparql_text)` for the serialised inner SPARQL SELECT, then checks `_pg_ripple.federation_cache` for a live row with matching `(url, query_hash)` and `expires_at > now()`. On a cache hit the stored `result_jsonb` is decoded in-process exactly as a live HTTP response would be. On a miss the result is stored with `expires_at = now() + interval '{ttl} seconds'`.

The merge background worker runs `DELETE FROM _pg_ripple.federation_cache WHERE expires_at < now()` during each merge cycle to prevent unbounded growth. `idx_federation_cache_expires` makes this deletion fast.

**Security note**: result_jsonb is stored as received from the remote endpoint. The executor already validates and re-encodes all terms via the dictionary during `encode_results()` — stale or tampered cache entries cannot inject arbitrary dictionary IDs because every term goes through the same `encode_ntriples_term()` path.

### Variable Projection Rewriting

When the SQL generator translates a SERVICE clause it now walks the outer query context (`Ctx`) to collect the set of SPARQL variables that are referenced outside the SERVICE block (in outer projections, JOINs, or FILTERs). The inner `SELECT *` is replaced with `SELECT ?v1 ?v2 ...` listing only those variables.

The rewrite is skipped when the outer context is a bare `SELECT *` (all variables projected) or when the set cannot be determined statically (e.g. variable endpoint). In those cases the executor falls back to `SELECT *` as before.

### Batch SERVICE Calls

When the SQL generator detects two or more `SERVICE <url>` clauses targeting the same endpoint within a single query, and those clauses share no variables between them (determined by inspecting their variable sets in the spargebra algebra), they are merged into a single HTTP call:

```sparql
SELECT * WHERE { { inner1 } UNION { inner2 } }
```

The combined result set is then partitioned back into per-clause bindings by matching on which variables each row has bound. This eliminates redundant TCP round-trips and remote parse overhead.

Batching is only applied when patterns are provably independent. Any shared variable between two SERVICE clauses disables batching for that pair and falls back to sequential execution.

### Result Deduplication at Encoding

`encode_results()` builds a per-call `HashMap<String, i64>` (term string → dictionary ID). For each cell, it checks the map before calling `dictionary::encode()`. On a hit the cached ID is reused directly; on a miss the ID is inserted into the map. This eliminates repeated dictionary SPI calls for high-cardinality result sets where the same IRI or literal appears thousands of times.

### Adaptive Timeout

When `pg_ripple.federation_adaptive_timeout = on`, `execute_remote()` reads the P95 latency for the target endpoint from `_pg_ripple.federation_health`:

```sql
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY latency_ms)
FROM _pg_ripple.federation_health
WHERE url = $1 AND probed_at >= now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
```

The effective timeout is `max(1000, p95_ms * 3)` milliseconds. If no health data is available or the feature is disabled, `pg_ripple.federation_timeout` is used as before. The adaptive value is never less than 1 second regardless of reported latency.

### Endpoint Complexity Ordering

The `complexity` column on `_pg_ripple.federation_endpoints` (`'fast'` / `'normal'` / `'slow'`) annotates expected endpoint speed. When a query contains multiple SERVICE clauses the SQL generator sorts them by complexity ascending before emitting SQL — `'fast'` endpoints are queried first. This is a static hint; it does not affect runtime scheduling once execution begins.

### New GUCs (v0.19.0)

| GUC | Type | Default | Range / Values | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pg_ripple.federation_pool_size` | INT | 4 | 1–32 | Idle HTTP connections kept per endpoint host |
| `pg_ripple.federation_cache_ttl` | INT | 0 | 0–86400 s | Remote result cache TTL; 0 = disabled |
| `pg_ripple.federation_on_partial` | ENUM | `'empty'` | `'empty'`, `'use'` | Behaviour when a remote call delivers partial results before failing |
| `pg_ripple.federation_adaptive_timeout` | BOOL | `off` | — | Use P95 latency from federation_health to set per-call timeout |

> **Target-state note**: The flow below is the **v0.6.0+ target architecture** after the HTAP split lands. In v0.1.0–v0.5.1, inserts write directly to the flat `_pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id}` table.

```
1. pg_ripple.insert_triple('http://ex.org/Alice', 'http://ex.org/knows', 'http://ex.org/Bob')
2. Dictionary encode: s=42, p=7, o=43
3. Look up predicate p=7 → vp_7 table
4. INSERT INTO _pg_ripple.vp_7_delta (s, o, g) VALUES (42, 43, 0)
5. If SHACL enabled: queue validation (async) or validate inline (sync)
6. Background worker periodically merges vp_7_delta → vp_7_main
```

## 6. Data Flow: Query Path

> **Target-state note**: The flow below is the **v0.6.0+ target architecture**. In v0.1.0–v0.5.1, queries read from the flat `_pg_ripple.vp_{predicate_id}` tables only.

```
1. pg_ripple.sparql('SELECT ?name WHERE { ?person foaf:knows ex:Bob . ?person foaf:name ?name }')
2. Parse → Algebra: Join(BGP(person, foaf:knows, ex:Bob), BGP(person, foaf:name, name))
3. Encode bound terms: ex:Bob → 43, foaf:knows → 7, foaf:name → 12
4. Generate SQL:
     SELECT d.o AS name
     FROM (SELECT s FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7 WHERE o = 43
           UNION ALL
           SELECT s FROM _pg_ripple.vp_7_delta WHERE o = 43) AS knows
     JOIN (SELECT s, o FROM _pg_ripple.vp_12
           UNION ALL
           SELECT s, o FROM _pg_ripple.vp_12_delta) AS name_tbl
       ON knows.s = name_tbl.s
5. Execute via SPI
6. Batch decode: collect all i64 IDs from result → single `WHERE id = ANY(...)` → build decode map
7. Emit decoded rows as SETOF JSONB: [{"name": "Alice"}, ...]
```

## 7. Performance Targets

> **Calibration reference**: QLever (C++, Apache-2.0) on DBLP (390M triples) loads at 1.7M triples/s, produces an 8 GB index, and answers benchmark queries in 0.7s average. QLever's flat pre-sorted permutation files make every SPARQL join a merge join with zero random I/O. pg_ripple's B-tree/heap design pays ~5× overhead on bulk sequential scans in exchange for transactional concurrent writes, MVCC, and the full PostgreSQL ecosystem. The targets below reflect this accepted trade-off.

> **Pre-HTAP baseline (v0.1.0–v0.5.1)**: Before the HTAP split lands in v0.6.0, all reads and writes target a single flat VP table. The CI performance gate during these releases uses a lower baseline (>30K triples/sec bulk insert) which improves to >100K after the delta/main split and BRIN indexing are in place.

| Metric | Target | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Insert throughput | >100K triples/sec (bulk load) | Batch COPY, deferred indexing |
| Insert throughput | >10K triples/sec (transactional) | Delta partition, async validation |
| Simple BGP query | <5ms (10M triples) | Integer joins, B-tree on VP tables |
| Star query (5 patterns) | <20ms (10M triples) | Self-join elimination, co-located VP scans, PG parallel hash joins |
| Property path (depth 10) | <100ms (10M triples) | Recursive CTE + `CYCLE` clause (hash-based) |
| Dictionary encode | <1μs (cache hit) | Sharded LRU in shared memory |
| Dictionary encode | <50μs (cache miss) | B-tree index on hash |
| Dictionary batch decode | <1ms per 1,000 IDs | Single `WHERE id = ANY(...)` query |
| Unbound-predicate scan | <500ms (10M triples, ≤60K predicates) | Rare-predicate consolidation table avoids scanning thousands of empty VP tables |

> **Unbound-predicate query verification (v0.3.0+)**: `find_triples(s, NULL, NULL)` and the SPARQL equivalent (`?s ?p ?o` without predicate binding) must efficiently enumerate the predicate catalog and query each relevant VP table before falling back to `vp_rare`. The implementation should use a single `UNION ALL` plan across matched VP tables rather than per-predicate round-trips through SPI. Benchmark this pattern explicitly at v0.3.0 against the <500 ms target with a 60K-predicate dataset (DBpedia scale). Vertical Partitioning inherently penalises exploratory/unbound queries relative to monolithic layouts; the rare-predicate table partially mitigates this but the mitigation should be verified empirically.

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests

- pgrx `#[pg_test]` for every SQL-exposed function
- Rust unit tests for pure logic (dictionary hashing, SPARQL algebra transforms, SQL generation)
- Property-based tests (`proptest`) for dictionary encode/decode round-trips

### 8.2 Integration Tests

- `cargo pgrx regress` with pg_regress test suites:
  - `sql/dictionary.sql` — encode/decode, prefix expansion, hash collision behaviour
  - `sql/basic_crud.sql` — insert, delete, find_triples, triple_count
  - `sql/triple_crud.sql` — insert, delete, query basics (VP storage)
  - `sql/sparql_queries.sql` — comprehensive SPARQL coverage
  - `sql/sparql_injection.sql` — adversarial inputs (SQL metacharacters in IRIs/literals)
  - `sql/bulk_load.sql` — Turtle/N-Triples ingestion
  - `sql/shacl_validation.sql` — constraint enforcement
  - `sql/shacl_malformed.sql` — invalid shape definitions, actionable errors
  - `sql/named_graphs.sql` — GRAPH patterns
  - `sql/property_paths.sql` — recursive traversal
  - `sql/resource_limits.sql` — Cartesian products, unbounded paths, memory limits
  - `sql/concurrent_write_merge.sql` — merge during concurrent writes (no data loss)
  - `sql/admin_functions.sql` — vacuum, reindex, stats
  - `sql/graph_rls.sql` — RLS policy enforcement, cross-role isolation
  - `sql/upgrade_path.sql` — sequential version upgrades with data integrity checks
  - `sql/datalog_malformed.sql` — syntax errors, unstratifiable programs

### 8.3 Adversarial & Security Testing

- **SQL injection prevention**: SPARQL queries with crafted IRIs containing SQL metacharacters (`'; DROP TABLE --`, Unicode escapes, null bytes) must be safely dictionary-encoded; generated SQL must never contain raw user strings
- **Malformed input resilience**: invalid Turtle, truncated N-Triples, malformed SPARQL, broken SHACL shapes, invalid Datalog rules — verify clean error messages, no panics, no partial state corruption
- **Resource exhaustion defence**: Cartesian-product queries, unbounded property paths, deeply nested subqueries — verify that `max_path_depth`, `statement_timeout`, and memory limits prevent runaway consumption

### 8.4 Fuzz Testing

**Phase 1 (v0.13.0 — Performance Hardening)**: Fuzz testing infrastructure is built and integrated into CI in v0.13.0 as part of the performance hardening and production-readiness work. This ensures the SPARQL→SQL pipeline, Turtle parser, and Datalog rule parser are robust against adversarial or malformed inputs before the system is declared production-ready.

- `cargo-fuzz` with libFuzzer on the SPARQL→SQL pipeline: feed random/mutated SPARQL strings through parser and SQL generator; verify no panics, no invalid SQL emitted, no memory safety violations
- Fuzz targets for Turtle parser integration (complement `rio_turtle`'s own fuzz testing with pg_ripple's error propagation layer)
- Fuzz targets for Datalog rule parser
- Run in CI nightly (time-limited: 10 minutes per target)
- Fuzz testing runs without panics or unsafe SQL generation across all parser surfaces

### 8.5 Concurrency Testing

- Concurrent dictionary encode: two backends encoding the same IRI must return the same i64 (verifies shard lock correctness)
- Dictionary cache eviction: verify decode correctness after cache entries are evicted under memory pressure
- Concurrent merge + write: bulk insert and merge worker running simultaneously with no data loss
- Merge worker edge cases: empty delta (no-op), crash during merge (recovery), near-capacity shared memory (back-pressure)

### 8.6 Performance Regression

- **CI benchmark gate** (from v0.2.0): record insert throughput and point-query latency as baselines; fail CI if a commit regresses throughput by >10%
- Baselines extended at each milestone:
  - v0.3.0: star queries
  - v0.5.0: BSBM full mix + property paths, resource exhaustion test suite validation
  - v0.6.0: concurrent read/write (HTAP workload)
  - v0.13.0: join reordering effectiveness, prepared statement reuse, fuzz testing coverage
- Performance regression suite maintained as pgbench custom scripts in `sql/bench/`
- **v0.13.0 consolidation**: All prior-version benchmarks are re-run and baseline values finalized; performance targets confirmed (<10ms simple BGP at 10M triples, >100K triples/sec bulk load, <5ms cached repeat queries)

### 8.7 Benchmarks

- **v0.5.0–v0.6.0 (Integration phase)**:
  - pgrx-bench integration for in-process pgbench
  - Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM) data generator adapted for bulk load
  - SP2Bench benchmark subset
  - Initial timing collection and baseline documentation
  
- **v0.13.0 (Finalization & Hardening)**:
  - BSBM results published in release notes
  - Benchmark workloads expanded: star patterns, property paths, aggregates, concurrent OLTP/OLAP
  - Baseline comparisons with v0.5.0 (pre-HTAP) and other systems (QLever, RDF4J, Oxigraph)
  - Each optimization in v0.13.0 validated against benchmarks for regression/improvement
  - Docker benchmark container with pre-loaded datasets for easy reproduction

### 8.8 Conformance

- **W3C SPARQL 1.1 Query conformance gate**: run applicable manifest tests from v0.3.0 onward; extend at each SPARQL milestone (v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v0.9.0, v0.12.0, v0.16.0) until full conformance at v1.0.0
- W3C SPARQL 1.1 Update test suite (from v0.12.0)
- W3C SHACL Core test suite (from v0.7.0)
- SPARQL 1.1 Protocol conformance tests via `curl` (from v0.15.0)

## 9. Project Structure

> **Target architecture**: This section describes the **intended end-state repository layout and module structure**, not a claim that every milestone or the current checkout already matches it exactly. The implementation plan is authoritative for the eventual architecture; intermediate releases may temporarily use a simpler layout while converging toward this structure.

> **Cargo workspace**: The target repository is a Cargo workspace with two members: `pg_ripple/` (the PostgreSQL extension) and `pg_ripple_http/` (the companion HTTP binary). The HTTP binary is an empty placeholder (`fn main() {}`) until v0.15.0. Establishing the workspace early in the target architecture avoids a structural disruption later that would break CI, dependency caches, and tooling.

# Empty binary until v0.15.0; only the dependencies below are added at v0.15.0.

```

### `pg_ripple/pg_ripple.control`

```
default_version = '0.1.0'
module_pathname = '$libdir/pg_ripple'
comment = 'High-performance RDF triple store with native SPARQL query support'
schema = 'pg_ripple'
relocatable = false
superuser = false
trusted = true
```

Key fields:
- `schema = 'pg_ripple'` — all user-visible objects are created in the `pg_ripple` schema; internal tables go in `_pg_ripple` (created explicitly in the SQL scripts, not governed by this field)
- `relocatable = false` — VP tables use schema-qualified names that cannot be relocated
- `trusted = true` — v0.1.0–v0.5.1 use no shared memory, background workers, or hooks, so any user with `CREATE` privilege can install the extension. **Changed to `trusted = false` in v0.6.0** when the HTAP architecture introduces `PgSharedMem` and background workers.

---

## 11. Security Considerations

- **SQL Injection**: All SQL generated by the SPARQL→SQL translator uses parameterized queries via SPI's `$N` parameter binding; no string interpolation of user data into SQL
- **Input validation**: RDF parsers (`rio_*`, `oxttl`) are well-tested and handle malformed input gracefully; all external input is validated before dictionary encoding
- **Privilege model**: Extension functions default to `SECURITY INVOKER`; schema `_pg_ripple` is only accessible by the extension owner
- **Resource limits**: `pg_ripple.max_path_depth` prevents unbounded recursive CTEs; `statement_timeout` respected for all SPI calls
- **Memory safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows; pgrx handles Postgres memory context integration
- **SSRF prevention** (v0.16.0 federation): the `SERVICE <url>` keyword can only contact endpoints explicitly registered in `_pg_ripple.federation_endpoints`. Any `SERVICE` clause referencing an unregistered IRI is rejected with a `PT610` error before any network connection is attempted. This prevents Server-Side Request Forgery — an attacker who can craft a SPARQL query cannot use it to probe internal network services or cloud metadata endpoints. The allowlist is managed via `pg_ripple.register_endpoint()` / `pg_ripple.remove_endpoint()` and is restricted to superusers by default.

---

## 12. Future Architecture (Post-1.0)

These items are documented for architectural awareness but are not in the 0.1–1.0 scope:

- **Distributed execution via Citus**: Subject-based sharding of VP tables across worker nodes
- **pgvector integration**: Store embeddings alongside graph nodes for hybrid semantic + vector search
- **Automated ExtVP**: Workload-driven analysis to automatically decide which semi-join stream tables to create (manual ExtVP via `create_sparql_view()` is in-scope for 0.x when pg_trickle is present)
- **Temporal versioning**: Bitstring validity columns for versioned graph snapshots
- **TimescaleDB integration**: Hypertable-backed temporal graph management
- **Cypher / GQL**: Query and write data using industry-standard graph query languages via a standalone `cypher-algebra` crate (see ROADMAP v1.6)
- **GraphQL-to-SPARQL bridge**: Auto-generate GraphQL schema from SHACL shapes
- **GeoSPARQL + PostGIS**: `geo:asWKT` literal type backed by PostGIS `geometry`, spatial FILTER functions, R-tree index on spatial VP tables (see ROADMAP v1.7)
- **OTTR template expansion**: `pg_ripple.expand_template(iri TEXT, query TEXT)` for OTTR-style DataFrame→RDF bulk load (see [prior_art_commercial.md](ecosystem/prior_art_commercial.md))
- **Ontology change propagation DAG**: When pg_trickle is present, model derived structures (ExtVP, inference, SHACL, stats) as a DAG of stream tables with automatic topological refresh on ontology changes

---

## 13. Operational Considerations

### 13.1 Merge Worker Health

- The merge worker registers a heartbeat timestamp in shared memory, updated on each cycle
- If the heartbeat stalls for longer than `pg_ripple.merge_watchdog_timeout` (default: 5 minutes), `_PG_init` on the next backend connection logs a `WARNING` and attempts to restart the worker
- `pg_ripple.stats()` includes `merge_worker_status` (`running` / `stalled` / `disabled`) and `merge_worker_last_heartbeat`

### 13.2 Shared-Memory Cache Lifecycle

- The dictionary LRU cache resides in `PgSharedMem` and survives individual backend crashes
- The cache is cleared on postmaster restart (standard PostgreSQL shared-memory lifecycle)
- Slot versioning (§4.1) detects layout mismatches after an in-place extension upgrade and re-initializes gracefully

### 13.3 `pg_upgrade` Behaviour

- Extension tables (`_pg_ripple.*`) migrate with standard `pg_upgrade` — no special handling required
- Shared-memory state (dictionary cache, bloom filters) is rebuilt from on-disk tables at the first `_PG_init` after the upgrade
- The slot versioning mechanism (§4.1) ensures safe re-initialization if the shared-memory layout changed between versions

### 13.4 Extension Downgrades

- Downgrades are **not supported** (standard for PostgreSQL extensions)
- Users should test upgrades on a staging instance and rely on `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` for rollback

### 13.5 Dictionary Vacuum Concurrency

- `pg_ripple.vacuum_dictionary()` acquires an `ADVISORY LOCK` to prevent concurrent runs
- Concurrent inserts are safe: the vacuum only deletes dictionary entries with zero references across all VP tables, checked via `NOT EXISTS` subqueries within a single snapshot
- Running `vacuum_dictionary()` during heavy bulk loads is discouraged but safe — it may miss newly-orphaned entries which will be cleaned on the next run

### 13.6 Error Code Taxonomy

Extension error messages use PostgreSQL-style formatting (lowercase first word, no trailing period). Error codes use the `PT` prefix:

| Range | Category |
|---|---|
| `PT001`–`PT099` | Dictionary errors (encoding failures, hash collisions, cache overflow) |
| `PT100`–`PT199` | Storage errors (VP table creation, merge failures, bulk load errors) |
| `PT200`–`PT299` | SPARQL errors (parse failures, unsupported features, query timeout) |
| `PT300`–`PT399` | SHACL errors (shape parse failures, validation violations) |
| `PT400`–`PT499` | Datalog errors (rule parse failures, stratification errors, constraint violations) |
| `PT500`–`PT599` | Admin errors (vacuum, reindex, upgrade) |
| `PT600`–`PT699` | Federation / HTTP errors (endpoint unreachable, SSRF rejection, timeout) |
| `PT700`–`PT799` | Serialization / export errors (format errors, encoding failures) |

## 14. Documentation

> **Authoritative source**: [plans/documentation.md](documentation.md) is the definitive specification for the documentation site — page list, section structure, tooling setup, and milestone delivery schedule. This section is a summary for implementers; always read `plans/documentation.md` alongside this plan when working on documentation deliverables.

### 14.1 Tooling

| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Site generator | [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages, published via `.github/workflows/docs.yml` |
| Diagrams | `mdbook-mermaid` preprocessor (added at v0.6.0) |
| Link validation | `mdbook-linkcheck` preprocessor (from day one) |
| Mirrored files | CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md, RELEASE.md, and all `plans/` research documents copied at CI build time — not symlinked |
| Local development | `cargo install mdbook && cd docs && mdbook serve` |

### 14.2 Site Structure

Three top-level sections, each a directory under `docs/src/`:

```
docs/src/
  user-guide/            — Task-oriented: install, query, configure, scale
    introduction.md
    installation.md
    getting-started.md
    playground.md        — Docker sandbox (⭐ highest adoption leverage)
    sql-reference/       — One page per SQL API surface area
    best-practices/      — Pattern guides (bulk loading, SPARQL, SHACL, Datalog)
    configuration.md     — All GUC parameters
    scaling.md
    pre-deployment.md
    upgrading.md
    backup-restore.md
    contributing.md
  reference/             — Look-up: errors, FAQ, changelog, runbook
    faq.md
    troubleshooting.md
    error-reference.md   — PT001–PT799 table
    changelog.md         — (mirrored)
    roadmap.md           — (mirrored)
    release-process.md   — (mirrored)
    security.md
  research/              — Architecture rationale, prior art, design decisions
    index.md
    prior-art.md
    postgresql-deepdive.md
    pg-trickle.md
    … (mirrors of plans/ documents)
```

### 14.3 Writing Conventions

- **Lead with what the user can do**, not implementation detail — "Load a Turtle file in one SQL call" before any mention of VP tables.
- **One working copy-paste example per function** in the SQL Reference.
- Implementation detail goes in a clearly marked "Internal / Advanced" subsection or a `<details>` block.
- Add `> **Available since vX.Y.Z**` callouts at the top of sections describing features not present from v0.1.0.
- Every SQL Reference page must link back to the roadmap milestone where the feature was introduced.

### 14.4 Milestone Delivery

Each ROADMAP.md version section includes a `### Documentation` subsection listing the specific `docs/src/` pages that must be created or expanded as part of that version's deliverables. Documentation checkboxes in those sections are treated the same as code deliverables — they must be ticked (`- [x]`) before a version is considered done and the exit criteria are satisfied.

**v0.5.0 special case**: Because v0.1.0–v0.4.0 shipped without any documentation, v0.5.0 carries the full catch-up backlog (site scaffold, installation, getting started, playground, SQL reference for all released APIs, best practices, FAQ, configuration, troubleshooting) in addition to its own new pages.

### 14.5 Error Reference Generation

The `reference/error-reference.md` page documents every PT error code (PT001–PT799, see §13.6). The target workflow is:
1. Error codes and their message templates are defined in `src/error.rs` and its subsystem-specific modules.
2. A build-time step or a manual curation pass extracts them into `docs/src/reference/error-reference.md`.
3. Each entry includes: code, subsystem, message template, and a resolution note written for operators, not developers.

The full PT001–PT799 table is due at v0.14.0 (see ROADMAP.md `### Documentation` for that version).
