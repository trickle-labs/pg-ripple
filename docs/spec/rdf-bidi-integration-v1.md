# RDF Bidirectional Integration Profile, v1 (draft)

> **Status**: Draft, vendor-neutral. Editor: pg_ripple project. Reference implementation: [pg_ripple](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-ripple) v0.77.0+.
>
> This document specifies a wire-level and behavioural profile that any RDF triplestore can implement to participate in **bidirectional integration** with external systems (CRMs, ERPs, SaaS APIs, other RDF stores) without per-relay reconciliation glue. The profile is grounded in W3C standards (RDF 1.1, RDF-star, OWL 2 RL, SHACL, SPARQL 1.1, JSON-LD 1.1, PROV-O) and adds nothing not derivable from them; its contribution is the *combination* and the *protocol*.
>
> "Bidirectional" means the same store can be both a source (emitting CDC-style change events) and a sink (ingesting change events), with conflicts, echoes, target-assigned identifiers, and cross-source equivalences handled by the protocol rather than by ad-hoc relay code.

## 1. Motivation

Every RDF triplestore today exposes some form of change-data-capture (Jena listeners, Stardog cluster events, Oxigraph diffs, GraphDB notifications, pg_ripple subscriptions). Each is bespoke. None addresses the harder questions that arise once a triplestore sits inside an integration topology:

1. **Source attribution**: which external system contributed which triple, and at what timestamp from *that system's* clock?
2. **Echo suppression**: when a write originating in system A is mirrored to system B and then mirrored back, how do we suppress the echo without losing legitimate concurrent edits from B?
3. **Conflict resolution**: when two sources disagree on a `sh:maxCount 1` predicate, which wins, and where do the losers go?
4. **Cross-source identity**: when system A and system B refer to the same real-world entity under different IRIs, how do we route writes correctly without a global IRI registry that has to be updated retroactively?
5. **Target-assigned identifiers**: when the integration target (e.g. an ERP) assigns the canonical ID *after* accepting a create, how do we tie the resulting IRI back to the originating event?
6. **Optimistic concurrency**: how does a relay safely apply an event without overwriting a concurrent edit it doesn't know about?
7. **Schema evolution**: how do mid-flight changes to the projected shape interact with queued events?
8. **Operational invariants**: queue limits, dead-letter, audit, RBAC, redaction, reconciliation.

Existing CDC mechanisms answer (1) implicitly at best and (2)–(8) not at all. The Bidi Profile answers all eight in a way every triplestore can implement.

## 2. Candidate conformance levels

This draft sketches candidate conformance levels for review. They are **non-normative** until the profile is extracted from the pg_ripple roadmap and stabilized.

A triplestore claims **Bidi-1.0 compliance** if it implements §3 (Data Model), §4 (Wire Format), §5 (Receiver Protocol), §6 (Reconciliation), and the §11 candidate conformance test corpus.

A triplestore claims **Bidi-1.0-Ops compliance** if it additionally implements §7 (Schema Evolution), §8 (Auth & Redaction), §9 (Audit), and §10 (Operations Surface).

A triplestore MAY implement only Bidi-1.0; it MUST NOT claim Bidi-1.0-Ops without Bidi-1.0.

## 3. Data model

### 3.1 Sources are named graphs

Every triple ingested from an external system MUST be stored in a named graph whose IRI uniquely identifies the source. The recommended convention is `urn:source:<system>` (e.g. `urn:source:crm`, `urn:source:erp`); implementations MUST NOT impose a different convention.

The default graph (RDF default graph; "graph 0" in some implementations) is reserved for triples that are not source-attributed. Bidi-Profile-compliant ingest MUST NOT write to the default graph.

### 3.2 Per-source timestamps

Source timestamps are carried as RDF-star annotations on triples, using the predicate `prov:generatedAtTime` (PROV-O). For a triple `<<:s :p :o>>`, the timestamp is asserted as:

```turtle
<< :s :p :o >> prov:generatedAtTime "2026-04-22T14:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

Implementations without RDF-star MAY use reification but MUST document the mapping.

### 3.3 Resolved projection

Implementations MUST maintain a derived projection answering "what is the current consensus value for `(subject, predicate)` across all sources?" This projection is non-destructive: source graphs retain their original triples; only the projection reflects the resolution.

Four resolution policies are defined. An implementation MUST support all four.

| Policy | Definition |
|---|---|
| `source_priority [s1, s2, ...]` | The value from the highest-priority source that has a value wins. Lower-priority sources contribute only when higher-priority sources are silent. |
| `latest_wins` | The value with the latest `prov:generatedAtTime` wins. Ties broken by source priority. |
| `reject_on_conflict` | If multiple sources have differing values, NO value enters the projection; the conflict is recorded for operator review. |
| `union` | All values enter the projection (only valid for predicates without `sh:maxCount 1`). |

Policies MAY be configured per-predicate or globally. The unit of resolution is `(subject, predicate)`, not `(subject, predicate, object)`.

### 3.4 Echo-aware normalization

Conflict policies MAY be qualified with a `normalize` SPARQL expression. Two values are considered "the same for conflict purposes" iff their normalized forms are equal. Examples:

```
latest_wins normalize=`STRDT(STR(?v), xsd:string)`     # ignore datatype mismatches
latest_wins normalize=`UCASE(STR(?v))`                  # case-insensitive
latest_wins normalize=`REPLACE(STR(?v), "[\\s-]", "")`  # ignore whitespace and hyphens
```

When the source-A and source-B values normalize to the same form, no conflict is raised and no event is emitted (echo suppression). Precision is preserved: the underlying triples retain their original lexical form; only conflict detection compares normalized forms.

### 3.5 Cross-source equivalence

Cross-source identity uses `owl:sameAs`. The protocol does not require full OWL 2 reasoning; it requires only the symmetric-transitive closure of `owl:sameAs` over the union of source graphs.

Implementations MUST provide a query primitive equivalent to "give me the equivalence class of IRI `i`" with bounded latency.

## 4. Wire format

### 4.1 Event shape

Outbound events are JSON documents with the following top-level schema:

```json
{
  "version":           "1.0",
  "event_id":          "<uuid>",
  "event_type":        "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE",
  "subject":           "<canonical-iri>",
  "subject_resolved":  true | false,
  "graph":             "<source-graph-iri>",
  "timestamp":         "<RFC 3339 instant>",
  "@context":          { ... JSON-LD context ... },
  "after":             { ... JSON-LD framed object ... },
  "base":              { ... JSON-LD framed object ... }
}
```

Field semantics:

- **`version`**: the only top-level discriminator. Receivers MUST switch on this. Future versions MUST remain forward-compatible-by-default; receivers ignore unknown fields.
- **`event_id`**: globally unique. Used for traceability and side-band callbacks such as linkback, divergence reporting, and abandon.
- **`event_type`**: one of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. SHACL semantics (atomic delete-then-insert) collapse to `UPDATE`.
- **`subject`**: the canonical hub IRI of the changed entity.
- **`subject_resolved`**: boolean. `true` means `subject` is already the IRI the receiver should use after late-binding rewrite under the receiver's `iri_match_pattern`; `false` means the event is an unresolved INSERT whose target-assigned ID must be reported via linkback before follow-up events are emitted.
- **`graph`**: the source graph IRI. The receiver uses this for echo detection (do not re-ingest events whose `graph` matches the receiver's own source graph).
- **`timestamp`**: the event emit time, RFC 3339.
- **`@context`**: JSON-LD context for `after` and `base`. SHOULD be a stable URL or a small inline context.
- **`after`**: the projected post-state of the entity, as a JSON-LD framed object. For `DELETE`, MUST be `null`.
- **`base`** (sparse-CAS): for `UPDATE`, the **sparse pre-state** of *only those predicates that changed*. For `INSERT`, MUST be `{}`. For `DELETE`, MUST be the full pre-deletion frame. See §5.2 for CAS semantics.

The schema URI for `version` is advertised via the HTTP `Link: rel="describedby"` header (§4.3). It MUST NOT be repeated inside every event body.

### 4.2 Framing symmetry rule

`after` and `base` MUST be framed under the *same* JSON-LD context and frame. Specifically:

- For every key present in both, the lexical representation of the value (string, number, list ordering, datatype tag presence) MUST be byte-identical when the underlying RDF values are equal.
- Implementations MUST NOT apply lossy normalization to one side and not the other.

This guarantees that receivers can perform CAS via byte-string equality (`actual[k] == base[k]`) without re-parsing.

### 4.3 HTTP transport

Implementations exposing events via HTTP MUST:

- Set `Content-Type: application/json` on event responses.
- Set `Link: <https://example.org/specs/bidi/v1/event.schema.json>; rel="describedby"` (with the implementation's actual schema URL).
- Use bearer-token auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Support per-route scope checks (§8.1).

Implementations MAY also offer a non-HTTP transport (Postgres SPI, gRPC, AMQP, Kafka). The wire format is identical regardless of transport.

### 4.4 Object-level grouping

One event MUST be emitted per `(subject, transaction)` pair. A transaction touching N subjects emits N events; a transaction touching one subject's K predicates emits one event with K populated keys in `after` and (for UPDATE) `base`.

Implementations MAY offer a triple-level grouping mode as a legacy escape hatch but it MUST be opt-in.

## 5. Receiver protocol

### 5.1 Delivery substrate

Receivers consume events from an implementation-defined at-least-once delivery substrate. This draft intentionally does not prescribe `pull`, `ack`, or `nack` functions: a conforming implementation MAY use transactional outbox tables, Kafka, NATS, webhooks, logical replication, or direct polling.

The substrate MUST provide at-least-once delivery, durable retry, and an operator-visible delivery dead-letter mechanism or equivalent failure surface. Implementations SHOULD expose delivery status (depth, last delivery, last error, retry/DLQ counts) through §10.

For pg_ripple, this substrate is pg-trickle's outbox/inbox and relay; pg_ripple itself does not expose `next_event`, `ack_event`, or `nack_event`.

### 5.2 Sparse-CAS application

For `UPDATE` events, the receiver applies the following algorithm:

```
for each (predicate, base_value) in event.base:
    actual_value = read_actual(target_system, event.subject, predicate)
    if actual_value == base_value:
        continue  # CAS holds for this predicate
    elif actual_value == event.after[predicate]:
        continue  # already applied; idempotent
    else:
        escalate(event, predicate, actual_value, base_value, event.after[predicate])
        return

apply_writes(target_system, event.subject, event.after)
mark_delivery_complete(event.event_id)  # substrate-specific
```

`escalate` MUST invoke the reconciliation toolkit (§6) rather than silently overwriting.

For `INSERT` events on a target system that assigns its own primary key, see §5.3.

For `DELETE` events, the receiver SHOULD verify `actual == base` for at least one identifying predicate before deleting; on mismatch, escalate.

### 5.3 Linkback for target-assigned identifiers

When the target system assigns the canonical ID for a fresh INSERT (e.g. an ERP returns `4011` after accepting a create), the receiver:

1. Performs the insert in the target system, captures the assigned ID.
2. Calls `record_linkback(event_id, target_id)` on the source store.

The source store:

1. Expands `target_id` through the receiving graph's `iri_template` to produce the target IRI.
2. Atomically writes `owl:sameAs` between the original `subject` and the expanded target IRI.
3. Flushes any subscription-buffered subsequent events for that subject (§5.4).

Implementations MUST also accept a `target_iri` form for cases where the target system returns a canonical URL rather than a bare ID.

The source store MUST make the initial unresolved INSERT visible to the receiver so the receiver can create the target entity and call `record_linkback`. Follow-up events for the same pending subject are held by §5.4 until linkback lands. Delivery completion for the unresolved INSERT is substrate-specific; implementations SHOULD document how redelivery behaves if linkback never arrives.

### 5.4 Subscription buffering during pending linkback

While a linkback is pending for `(subject, subscription)`, subsequent events for the same `(subject, subscription)` MUST be persisted in unrendered form and flushed atomically when `record_linkback` lands. Implementations MUST NOT emit follow-up events for an entity whose target ID is not yet known.

If the linkback never lands (operator abandonment, target system failure), buffered events MUST be expired after `linkback_timeout` (default 1 h) with operator notification.

### 5.5 Late-binding IRI rewrite

When emitting an event for subject `s` to a subscription whose `target_graph` is `g`:

1. Compute the equivalence class `E = closure_owl_sameAs(s)`.
2. If any member of `E` matches the `iri_match_pattern` for `g`, emit that member as `subject` and set `subject_resolved = true`.
3. Otherwise, emit the canonical hub IRI as `subject` and set `subject_resolved = false` only for unresolved INSERTs that require linkback; for other event types, emit according to the implementation's missing-rewrite policy.

This rewrite is **late-binding**: it happens at emit time, not at write time. Closure changes (new `owl:sameAs` discovered) MUST NOT retroactively rewrite already-queued events.

### 5.6 Loop prevention

Subscriptions MUST support an `exclude_graphs` parameter. Events whose `graph` field appears in the excluded list MUST be filtered out.

Subscriptions MUST support a `propagation_depth` parameter (default `1`). A change to a triple in graph G triggers events for G plus equivalent triples discoverable through up to `propagation_depth` `owl:sameAs` hops, but no further. This bounds fan-out in densely linked equivalence classes.

## 6. Reconciliation

When sparse-CAS fails (§5.2 `escalate`), the receiver MUST enqueue a reconciliation entry:

```
reconciliation_enqueue(
    event_id,
    divergence_summary = {
        predicate_iri: { actual: ..., base: ..., after: ... },
        ...
    }
)
```

Implementations SHOULD provide an operator-facing primitive `reconciliation_next(subscription)` that leases the next unresolved entry using `SKIP LOCKED` or an equivalent work-queue mechanism. This is a reconciliation queue, not the main event-delivery substrate.

Implementations MUST support four resolution actions:

| Action | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `accept_external` | Ingest the external system's actual value into the corresponding source graph as if it had arrived via normal ingest. The original event is acked as a no-op. |
| `force_internal` | Re-emit the same event marked as a force overwrite. The receiver applies it ignoring `base`. |
| `merge_via_owl_sameAs` | Assert `owl:sameAs` between the divergent values' subjects (used when divergence reveals a duplicate). Ack the original event. |
| `dead_letter` | Move the event to the dead-letter store with the divergence summary attached. |

Implementations MAY offer additional actions but MUST NOT redefine these four.

## 7. Schema evolution

Subscriptions evolve over time: frames change, IRI templates / match patterns change, exclude lists change. The protocol defines explicit policies for each.

### 7.1 Frame changes

When a subscription's frame is altered, queued events are affected per `frame_change_policy`:

- `new_events_only` (recommended default): already-rendered queued events drain unchanged; new events use the new frame.
- `reframe_queued` and `drain_then_switch` are advanced implementation-defined policies. They require queued events to be stored in unrendered form and are not required by this draft.

### 7.2 IRI template / match-pattern changes

When a graph's `iri_template` or `iri_match_pattern` is altered, queued events are affected per `iri_change_policy`:

- `new_events_only` (recommended default): queued events keep the original rendered IRIs; new events use the new template / match pattern.
- Retroactive re-rewrite is implementation-defined and requires unrendered queued events.

### 7.3 Exclude-graphs changes

When `exclude_graphs` is altered, queued events are affected per `exclude_change_policy`:

- `new_events_only` (recommended default): the new exclude list applies only to events emitted after the change. Queued events drain unchanged.
- Retroactive filtering of queued events is implementation-defined.

All schema changes MUST be recorded in an audit table with the old value, new value, applied policy, and affected event count.

## 8. Auth and redaction

### 8.1 Per-subscription scope tokens

Implementations MUST support bearer tokens scoped to a single subscription with a subset of the following permissions:

| Scope | Permits |
|---|---|
| `linkback` | `record_linkback` |
| `divergence` | Report CAS divergence |
| `abandon` | Abandon pending linkback |
| `outbox_read` | Read a subscription's outbox table or equivalent delivery stream |
| `dead_letter_admin` | Requeue/drop semantic dead-letter rows |

Tokens MUST be SHA-256 hashed at rest. The raw token MUST be returned only at registration time.

A token registered for subscription A MUST NOT permit operations on subscription B, even with matching scopes.

### 8.2 Frame-level redaction

Frames MAY mark predicates with `"@redact": true`:

```json
{
  "@context": { "ex": "https://example.com/ns#" },
  "@type":    "ex:Contact",
  "ex:name":  {},
  "ex:phone": { "@redact": true },
  "ex:taxId": { "@redact": true }
}
```

For redacted consumers, redacted predicates MUST be emitted in `after` and `base` as the literal object `{"@redacted": true}`. Redacted predicates are not independently CAS-verifiable by receivers that only see the redacted delivery surface. Predicates requiring strict receiver-side CAS MUST be delivered through an unredacted surface or omitted from `base`.

For unredacted consumers, the cleartext value MAY be emitted through a separate subscription, outbox, stream, or authorization boundary. Implementations SHOULD prefer write-time redaction with separate redacted/unredacted delivery surfaces over per-token pull-time rendering.

## 9. Audit

Implementations MUST record every side-band mutating call (`record_linkback`, divergence report, abandon, semantic dead-letter requeue/drop, reconciliation resolve) with at minimum:

| Field | Required |
|---|---|
| `event_id` (or `reconciliation_id`) | Yes |
| `subscription_name` | Yes |
| `action` | Yes |
| `actor_token_hash` | Yes when called via authenticated transport |
| `actor_session` | Yes when called via direct query interface |
| `remote_addr` | Yes when called via HTTP |
| `observed_at` | Yes |

Delivery substrate audit (pull/ack/nack, sink delivery, retry) is implementation-defined and MAY live outside the Bidi store.

Implementations MUST provide a configurable retention window with a default of 90 days.

## 10. Operations surface

Implementations MUST expose a per-subscription status view with at minimum:

- queue depth
- oldest-event age
- dead-letter count
- conflict-rejection rate (rolling window)
- pending-linkback count and oldest-pending age
- delivery-substrate status such as last delivery timestamp, last error, retry count, and delivery-DLQ count
- reconciliation-open count

Implementations MUST expose a single overall health status with values `healthy` / `degraded` / `paused` / `failing` and a list of triggering conditions. The mapping rules are at the implementation's discretion but MUST be documented.

Implementations exposing HTTP MUST return `503` from a health endpoint when status is `failing`.

## 11. Conformance test corpus

A reference test corpus accompanies this specification at `tests/bidi-conformance/` (TBD; pg_ripple ships an interim version under `tests/fixtures/bidi/`). The corpus consists of black-box scenarios:

| Scenario | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `single_source_insert` | Ingest one triple under `urn:source:s1`; verify it appears in the resolved projection and emits one INSERT event. |
| `two_source_latest_wins` | Ingest conflicting `sh:maxCount 1` values from `s1` and `s2`; verify the latest timestamp wins; verify one UPDATE event with sparse `base`. |
| `echo_suppression` | Ingest from `s1`, mirror to `s2`, mirror back; verify no second event under the `normalize` rule. |
| `late_binding_rewrite` | Ingest `s1` reference to `s2:foo` before `owl:sameAs(s2:foo, s1:bar)` is asserted; verify the next event for `s1:bar` carries `subject = s2:foo` and `subject_resolved = true`; verify already-rendered queued events do NOT retroactively rewrite. |
| `linkback_round_trip` | Emit INSERT to a subscription with target-assigned IDs; record linkback with bare ID; verify `owl:sameAs` written; verify subsequent UPDATE for the same subject carries the rewritten IRI. |
| `subscription_buffer_flush` | Same as linkback_round_trip but with a second event emitted before the linkback lands; verify the second event is buffered and flushes atomically when the linkback lands. |
| `cas_divergence_escalates` | Receiver applies UPDATE; meanwhile target system has changed `actual` independently; verify CAS fails and reconciliation enqueues. |
| `four_resolutions` | For each of the four resolution actions, drive the reconciliation to that resolution and assert the resulting state. |
| `frame_change_new_events_only` | Alter frame mid-flight; verify already-rendered queued events drain under the old frame and newly emitted events use the new frame. |
| `frame_change_advanced_policy` | Optional: implementation that supports queued re-framing or drain-then-switch proves queued events are stored unrendered and do not race delivery. |
| `redacted_predicate` | Frame predicate with `@redact`; verify the redacted delivery surface emits `{"@redacted": true}` and the unredacted delivery surface emits cleartext when configured. |
| `scope_isolation` | Token for subscription A used against subscription B; verify rejection. |
| `dead_letter_overflow` | Push events past `max_queue_depth` under each of the three overflow policies; verify expected dead-letter contents. |
| `audit_completeness` | After a round of linkback/divergence/resolve/dead-letter admin actions, verify each side-band mutating call has exactly one audit record. |
| `convergence_random` | Apply 1000 random insert/update/delete operations from 4 sources; verify the resolved projection is independent of operation arrival order under `latest_wins`. |

Candidate mapping: Bidi-1.0 would cover scenarios 1–8; Bidi-1.0-Ops would additionally cover 9–15. This draft does not make those gates normative yet.

## 12. Non-normative reference implementation

[pg_ripple](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-ripple) v0.77.0+ is the reference implementation. The mapping from this specification's vocabulary to pg_ripple-specific surface is documented at [docs/src/operations/pg-trickle-relay.md](../src/operations/pg-trickle-relay.md). pg_ripple-specific concerns out of scope for this specification:

- Storage layout (HTAP delta/main partitioning).
- Queue substrate (Postgres tables with `SKIP LOCKED` leases).
- HTTP companion service.
- Migration mechanism.
- Prometheus metric naming.

Other triplestores implementing this profile are free to adopt different substrates as long as the protocol observable from the wire matches §4–§10.

## 13. Versioning

This specification is versioned via the top-level `version` field on events. Backwards-incompatible changes require a major version bump; receivers MAY refuse unknown major versions. Backwards-compatible additions require a minor version bump and MUST be ignorable by receivers that do not understand them.

Schema URLs follow the pattern `https://<editor>/specs/bidi/v<MAJOR>/event.schema.json` and MUST be advertised via HTTP `Link: rel="describedby"` (§4.3).

## 14. Security considerations

- Tokens MUST be hashed at rest. Implementations storing raw tokens are non-conformant.
- Per-subscription scope checks are mandatory; a global "admin" token is permitted for operator endpoints but MUST NOT be accepted for per-subscription transport calls.
- Frame-level redaction is a defense-in-depth measure, not a substitute for transport encryption. HTTPS is REQUIRED for the HTTP transport.
- Audit logs SHOULD be append-only or backed by an append-only store; implementations permitting deletion MUST log the deletion.
- The `force_internal` reconciliation action SHOULD require elevated authorization.

## 15. Recommended Qualifier Vocabulary (non-normative)

Implementations using RDF-star annotations (§3.2) to carry per-statement context are encouraged to follow this vocabulary. These predicates are recommended, not mandatory; implementations MAY use alternatives and MUST document their choices.

### Temporal

| Predicate | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `prov:generatedAtTime` | Timestamp from the source system | `<< :s :p :o >> prov:generatedAtTime "2026-04-22T14:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .` |
| `dcterms:valid` | Validity interval (start, end, or point in time) | `<< :s :contract :active "true"^^xsd:boolean >> dcterms:valid "[2026-01-01T00:00:00Z, 2026-12-31T23:59:59Z]"^^xsd:string .` |
| `prov:startedAtTime` | When a relationship/state began | `<< :contact :employedAt :company >> prov:startedAtTime "2020-01-15T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .` |
| `prov:endedAtTime` | When a relationship/state ended | `<< :contact :employedAt :company >> prov:endedAtTime "2024-03-31T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .` |

### Source Provenance

| Predicate | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `prov:wasGeneratedBy` | Link to the activity/actor that produced this value | `<< :s :p :o >> prov:wasGeneratedBy [ a prov:Activity ; prov:agent <urn:agent:salesforce-sync> ] .` |
| `dcterms:source` | Reference URL or identifier of the originating system | `<< :s :phone :value >> dcterms:source "https://salesforce.com/records/0011..." .` |

### Quality / Confidence

| Predicate | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `prov:confidence` | Confidence score (0–1); useful for ML-derived enrichment | `<< :contact :likelyRole "VP Marketing" >> prov:confidence "0.87"^^xsd:decimal .` |
| `dcterms:issued` | Date the assertion was made (as opposed to effective date) | `<< :product :costPerUnit "123.45" >> dcterms:issued "2026-04-20"^^xsd:date .` |

### Integration-Specific

| Predicate | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `bidi:sourceSystemId` (implementation-defined) | External system's internal ID for this assertion; enables round-trip linkback | `<< :s :p :o >> bidi:sourceSystemId "SF-0011-PHONE-2026" .` |
| `bidi:integrationTimestamp` (implementation-defined) | When the assertion was ingested into the integration layer | `<< :s :p :o >> bidi:integrationTimestamp "2026-04-22T14:15:33Z"^^xsd:dateTime .` |

**Usage note**: avoid creating new predicates for each integrator. Use these standard ones where they fit; for implementation-specific metadata, adopt a consistent URI namespace (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/integration/v1#`) and document it in your mapping definitions.
