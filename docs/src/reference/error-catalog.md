# Error Message Catalog

pg_ripple uses structured error codes in the range **PT001–PT799**, organized by subsystem. Error messages follow PostgreSQL conventions: lowercase first word, no trailing period.

```admonish tip title="Finding the error code"
Error codes appear in the `DETAIL` field of PostgreSQL error messages. Use `\errverbose` in psql to see the full error context including the code.
```

## PT001–PT099: Dictionary

Errors from the IRI/literal/blank-node → integer encoding subsystem.

| Code | Message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| PT001 | dictionary encode failed: hash collision detected | Two distinct terms produced the same XXH3-128 hash (extremely rare) | Report to maintainers with the two colliding terms |
| PT002 | dictionary decode failed: id not found | The integer ID does not exist in `_pg_ripple.dictionary` | Data may be corrupt; run `pg_ripple.vacuum_dictionary()` and check VP tables |
| PT003 | invalid term kind: expected 0 (IRI), 1 (literal), 2 (blank node) | Wrong `kind` integer passed to `encode_term()` | Use 0 for IRIs, 1 for literals, 2 for blank nodes |
| PT004 | quoted triple components not found | A quoted-triple ID references `qt_s`/`qt_p`/`qt_o` values that are missing from the dictionary | Re-load the RDF-star data; may indicate a partial load failure |
| PT005 | inline-encoded literal decode failed | Internal decoding error for small inline-encoded literals | Report to maintainers with the literal value |
| PT006 | dictionary batch insert failed | The `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING … RETURNING` batch insert encountered an unexpected error | Check PostgreSQL logs for disk space or permission issues |
| PT007 | dictionary lookup: NULL term | A NULL value was passed where an IRI, literal, or blank node was expected | Ensure all arguments are non-NULL |
| PT008 | malformed IRI: `<detail>` | The IRI string does not conform to RFC 3987 | Fix the IRI syntax; IRIs must be wrapped in angle brackets `<…>` |
| PT009 | malformed literal: `<detail>` | The literal string cannot be parsed | Use N-Triples syntax: `"value"`, `"value"@lang`, or `"value"^^<datatype>` |
| PT010 | malformed blank node: `<detail>` | The blank node label is invalid | Blank nodes must start with `_:` followed by a valid label |
| PT011 | dictionary cache full, eviction failed | The LRU cache could not evict entries | Increase `pg_ripple.dictionary_cache_size` |
| PT012 | prewarm_dictionary_hot: table not found | The dictionary table does not exist | Run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple` first |

| PT106 | VP table not found: `<table_name>` | The VP table referenced in `_pg_ripple.predicates` does not exist on disk | Run `pg_ripple.compact()` to reconcile the catalog |
| PT107 | delta table insert failed | Error writing to the HTAP delta partition | Check PostgreSQL logs for tablespace or permission issues |
| PT108 | tombstone insert failed | Error recording a deletion in the tombstones table | Check PostgreSQL logs |
| PT109 | merge worker: unexpected state | The background merge worker encountered an inconsistent state | Restart PostgreSQL; check `pg_log` for crash details |
| PT110 | statement_id_seq: sequence exhausted | The global statement ID sequence has reached its maximum | This is unlikely with `BIGINT`; contact maintainers |
| PT111 | vp_rare: row limit exceeded | The rare-predicate table has too many rows for a single predicate | Manually promote with `promote_rare_predicates()` or lower `pg_ripple.vp_promotion_threshold` |
| PT112 | deduplicate: advisory lock not acquired | Another deduplication operation is already running | Wait and retry |
| PT113 | create_graph: invalid graph IRI | The graph IRI is malformed | Graph IRIs must be valid absolute IRIs in angle brackets |

| PT505 | infer_wfs: three-valued model contains undefined atoms | Some atoms could not be classified as true or false | This is expected in WFS; query the `undefined` result set to see which atoms |
| PT506 | tabling: memo store overflow | The tabling memo store exceeded its size limit | Increase `pg_ripple.tabling_memo_size` |
| PT507 | infer_agg: aggregation cycle detected | An aggregation rule depends on its own aggregate result | Rewrite to break the cycle |

| PT510 | infer_agg: aggregation-stratification violation | A rule's aggregate depends (directly or through recursion) on its own derived result | Rewrite rules so that aggregated predicates are not re-used in the rule set that derives them |
| PT511 | infer_agg: unsupported aggregate function | The rule uses an aggregate not supported by the SQL compiler | Use one of `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` |
| PT520 | infer_wfs: iteration cap reached (`<N>` iterations) | The WFS alternating fixpoint did not converge within `pg_ripple.wfs_max_iterations` | Emitted as WARNING; partial result is returned with `"stratifiable": false`; increase the cap or simplify the rule set |
| PT530 | DRed cycle detected: `<rule_set>` | Delete-Rederive detected a cycle in the rule derivation graph that it cannot safely resolve; the system falls back to full recompute | This is a WARNING, not an error; the operation still succeeds. Reduce cyclic dependencies in your rule set, or set `pg_ripple.dred_enabled = off` to always use full recompute |
| PT540 | lattice: fixpoint did not converge after `<N>` iterations | The lattice fixpoint did not stabilise within `pg_ripple.lattice_max_iterations` | Increase `pg_ripple.lattice_max_iterations` or verify that the join function is monotone |
| PT541 | lattice: join_fn `<name>` could not be resolved | The user-supplied join function name could not be resolved via `regprocedure` | Check the function name, schema, and argument types; use a fully-qualified name |
| PT542 | federation: result decoder received unparseable XML/JSON | The SPARQL results response from a remote SERVICE endpoint could not be parsed | Check the endpoint's response format; ensure it returns `application/sparql-results+xml` or `+json` |
| PT543 | federation response body exceeds `federation_max_response_bytes` | The HTTP response body from a remote SERVICE endpoint is larger than the configured limit | Increase `pg_ripple.federation_max_response_bytes`, or set it to `-1` to disable; consider filtering at the remote endpoint instead |
| PT550 | owl:sameAs cluster too large: `<size>` members | An `owl:sameAs` equivalence class exceeds `pg_ripple.sameas_max_cluster_size`; canonicalization is skipped for this cluster | Investigate the data for spurious `owl:sameAs` triples; increase the limit if the cluster is legitimate |

| PT606 | SERVICE endpoint blocked by federation_endpoint_policy | The federation endpoint URL was blocked by `pg_ripple.federation_endpoint_policy` (v0.55.0). Blocked targets include RFC-1918 addresses, loopback, link-local, and `file://` URLs in `default-deny` mode, or URLs not in `federation_allowed_endpoints` in `allowlist` mode | Set `federation_endpoint_policy = 'open'` (dev only), add the URL to `federation_allowed_endpoints`, or use a public endpoint. Also used as the streaming-interrupted code (v0.48.0 meaning: streaming export was cancelled) |
| PT607 | vector service endpoint not registered | The vector endpoint URL is not registered in `_pg_ripple.federation_endpoints` | Register the endpoint with `pg_ripple.register_endpoint()` |
| PT620 | SERVICE result set exceeds inline limit | The remote SERVICE returned more rows than `pg_ripple.federation_inline_max_rows`; results were materialized via a temp table instead | Increase `federation_inline_max_rows` or filter at the remote endpoint |
| PT621 | register_endpoint: private IP rejected | The endpoint URL resolves to a private/loopback IP and `pg_ripple.federation_allow_private = off` | Set `federation_allow_private = on` (development only) or use a public endpoint |
| PT640 | SPARQL result set exceeded sparql_max_rows | The result set was too large; truncated to `pg_ripple.sparql_max_rows` | Increase `pg_ripple.sparql_max_rows` or add LIMIT/OFFSET to the query |
| PT642 | export truncated to `<N>` rows | The streaming export hit `pg_ripple.export_max_rows` | Increase `pg_ripple.export_max_rows` or paginate using OFFSET |
