# W3C Conformance

This page summarises pg_ripple's conformance status against the W3C SPARQL 1.1, Apache Jena, SHACL Core, WatDiv, and LUBM test suites.

As of v0.41.0, conformance is measured by integrated test harnesses that run in CI on every push to `main`. Pass rates are published as the `conformance_report` artifact on the [Actions page](https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-ripple/actions).

## Test suites

pg_ripple runs four complementary conformance suites:

| Suite | Tests | What it validates |
|---|---|---|
| **W3C SPARQL 1.1** | ~3 000 | Standard conformance on small, well-defined fixtures |
| **Apache Jena** | ~1 000 | Implementation edge cases (type coercion, date-time, blank-node scoping) |
| **WatDiv** | 100 templates | Correctness and performance at 10M-triple scale |
| **LUBM** | 14 queries | OWL RL inference correctness under ontological reasoning (v0.44.0+) |
| **OWL 2 RL** | ~200 tests | W3C OWL 2 RL entailment, consistency, and inconsistency (v0.46.0+; informational until ≥95%) |

All suites write per-suite results into a unified `tests/conformance/report.json` artifact.

See [Running Conformance Tests](running-conformance-tests.md) for local setup instructions, the [WatDiv Results](watdiv-results.md) page for performance metrics, and the [LUBM Results](lubm-results.md) page for OWL RL conformance details.

## W3C SPARQL 1.1 test harness (v0.41.0+)

The test harness (`tests/w3c/`) runs the official [W3C SPARQL 1.1 test suite](https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/) (~3 000 tests across 13 sub-suites) against a live pg_ripple installation.

### Per-category coverage

| Sub-suite | Tests | CI status |
|---|---|---|
| aggregates | ~120 | Required (smoke) |
| bind | ~20 | Informational (full suite) |
| exists | ~20 | Informational (full suite) |
| functions | ~200 | Informational (full suite) |
| grouping | ~40 | Required (smoke) |
| negation | ~20 | Informational (full suite) |
| optional | ~80 | Required (smoke) |
| project-expression | ~10 | Informational (full suite) |
| property-path | ~60 | Informational (full suite) |
| service | ~10 | SKIP (live external endpoints) |
| subquery | ~20 | Informational (full suite) |
| syntax-query | ~300 | Informational (full suite) |
| update | ~200 | Informational (full suite) |

### Running locally

```sh
# Download test data first (one-time setup):
bash scripts/fetch_conformance_tests.sh --w3c

# Run smoke subset (180 tests, ~30s):
cargo test --test w3c_smoke

# Run full W3C suite (3000+ tests, ~2min with 8 threads):
cargo test --test w3c_suite -- --test-threads 8
```

---

## Apache Jena test suite (v0.43.0+)

The Jena adapter (`tests/jena/`) runs ~1 000 tests from Apache Jena's `sparql-query`, `sparql-update`, `sparql-syntax`, and `algebra` sub-suites.  Jena tests cover implementation edge cases that the W3C suite leaves underspecified.

### Jena-specific coverage areas

| Area | Tests |
|---|---|
| XSD numeric promotions (`xsd:integer` → `xsd:decimal` → `xsd:double`) | sparql-query |
| Mixed-type arithmetic and comparisons | sparql-query |
| Timezone-aware `xsd:dateTime` comparisons | sparql-query |
| Date/time built-ins: `NOW()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`, `HOURS()`, `MINUTES()`, `SECONDS()`, `TZ()` | sparql-query |
| `xsd:decimal` arithmetic: `ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`, `ABS()` | sparql-query |
| Blank nodes in CONSTRUCT templates | sparql-query |
| Blank-node identity across OPTIONAL and GRAPH boundaries | sparql-query |
| String functions: `STRLEN()`, `SUBSTR()`, `UCASE()`, `LCASE()`, `STRSTARTS()`, `STRENDS()`, `CONTAINS()`, `ENCODE_FOR_URI()`, `CONCAT()` | sparql-query |
| SPARQL UPDATE edge cases | sparql-update |
| Syntax acceptance / rejection (positive/negative syntax tests) | sparql-syntax |
| Algebra normalisation equivalences | algebra |

### CI status

The `jena-suite` CI job is **non-blocking** until pass rate ≥ 95%, then promoted to required.  Known failures for type-coercion and date-time edge cases are tracked in `tests/conformance/known_failures.txt` with the `jena:` prefix.

### Running locally

```sh
# Download Jena test data:
bash scripts/fetch_conformance_tests.sh --jena

# Run the full Jena suite:
cargo test --test jena_suite
```
