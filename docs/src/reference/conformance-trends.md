# Conformance Trends

> **T13-04 (v0.86.0)**: this page tracks pg_ripple's pass rates across all five conformance suites over time.

The raw data is in [`tests/conformance/history.csv`](../../tests/conformance/history.csv). The CI job `conformance-trends` appends a row after each successful main-branch build.

## CI Badges (v0.122.0)

The Apache Jena pass rate is published as a CI badge after each main-branch build.
The badge JSON is written to `results/jena-badge.json` by the `jena-suite` CI job.

To reference the current pass rate in documentation or a README:

```markdown
![Jena](results/jena-badge.json)
```

The badge data format follows the [shields.io endpoint schema](https://shields.io/endpoint):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "label": "Jena",
  "message": "99% pass",
  "color": "green"
}
```

Color thresholds: green ≥ 95%, yellow ≥ 90%, orange ≥ 80%, red < 80%.
