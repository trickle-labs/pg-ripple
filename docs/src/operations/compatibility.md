# pg_ripple / pg_ripple_http Compatibility Matrix

`pg_ripple` (the PostgreSQL extension) and `pg_ripple_http` (the standalone HTTP companion
service) are versioned independently. This page documents which extension versions are compatible
with which HTTP companion versions and what guarantees apply to the combination.

## Versioning policy

- **pg_ripple** follows semantic versioning tied to extension features and PostgreSQL catalog changes.
- **pg_ripple_http** follows its own version series (currently `0.x.y`) since it is a standalone
  binary with its own release cadence. The HTTP companion version number tracks the *minimum*
  pg_ripple extension version it was tested against.

A given `pg_ripple_http` release is compatible with the extension version range
`[tested_with, next_major)`. The HTTP companion logs a warning at startup if the installed
extension version is outside its known-compatible range.

## Startup version check

Starting with `pg_ripple_http` 0.16.0, the HTTP companion performs a compatibility check at
startup. It queries the installed extension version and compares it against its known-compatible
range. If the extension is older than the minimum supported version:

- **Warning** is logged: the companion starts but logs a prominent warning.
- The `GET /ready` endpoint returns HTTP 503 with `{"compatible": false, ...}` if the extension
  is below the hard minimum.

The check can be disabled with `PG_RIPPLE_HTTP_SKIP_COMPAT_CHECK=1` for testing scenarios where
an older extension is intentionally paired with a newer companion.

> **⚠ Production warning (COMPAT-DOC-01 / MF-R):**
> `PG_RIPPLE_HTTP_SKIP_COMPAT_CHECK=1` is intended **only for testing and development** where
> you deliberately need to run a mismatched pair (e.g., integration tests against an older
> extension). **Do not set this in production environments.** Skipping the check allows the
> HTTP companion to serve requests to an incompatible extension, which can result in silent data
> corruption, unexpected errors, or security vulnerabilities when new SQL functions are called
> against an older extension schema. If you need to silence the compatibility warning in
> production, upgrade the extension or the companion to a compatible version pair instead.

## Independent versioning rationale

The HTTP companion is distributed as a pre-built binary. Extension upgrades (`ALTER EXTENSION
pg_ripple UPDATE`) are applied in-database and do not require rebuilding or redeploying the
companion. This means:

1. A single `pg_ripple_http` binary can serve multiple extension versions within its compatible range.
2. Extension-only changes (new SQL functions, GUCs, performance improvements) do not require a
   companion update.
3. Breaking API changes (new required request fields, removed endpoints) do require a companion
   update.

## Upgrade procedure

1. Upgrade the extension first: `ALTER EXTENSION pg_ripple UPDATE TO 'X.Y.Z';`
2. Restart or redeploy `pg_ripple_http` if a companion upgrade is also required.
3. Verify compatibility via `GET /ready` — returns `{"compatible": true}` when correctly paired.

## pg_tide / pg_trickle Extension Compatibility

pg_ripple integrates with two companion PostgreSQL extensions:

| Extension | Purpose | Required for |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| pg_trickle ≥ 0.46.0 | Incremental materialized view maintenance (IVM only) | SPARQL views, Datalog views, CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE/ASK views, ExtVP |
| pg_tide ≥ 0.4.0 | Relay, outbox, and inbox subsystem | Bidirectional relay (BIDI-OUTBOX-01, BIDI-INBOX-01), hub-and-spoke integration |

> **Architecture change (pg_ripple v0.93.0 / pg_trickle v0.46.0)**: pg_trickle v0.46.0 extracted
> the relay, outbox, and inbox subsystem (~6,150 Rust LOC + ~2,500 SQL LOC) into the new standalone
> `pg_tide` extension (`trickle-labs/pg-tide`). Starting with v0.93.0, pg_ripple recognises
> pg_tide as the recommended relay transport layer.

### pg_ripple + pg_trickle compatibility

| pg_ripple version | pg_trickle version | IVM status |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------|
| ≥ 0.112.0 | ≥ 0.57.0 | ✅ IVM only (relay features in pg_tide) |
| ≥ 0.93.0 | ≥ 0.46.0 | ✅ IVM only (relay features in pg_tide) |
| ≥ 0.93.0 | ≤ 0.45.0 | ⚠ IVM works; relay features require manual migration to pg_tide |
| 0.52.0 – 0.92.0 | any | ✅ Full relay+IVM (pre-extraction) |

### pg_ripple + pg_tide compatibility

| pg_ripple version | pg_tide version | Relay status |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| ≥ 0.93.0 | ≥ 0.4.0 | ✅ Full relay support (tide.* API) |
| ≥ 0.93.0 | 0.1.0 – 0.3.x | ✅ Core relay support (tide.* API, older feature set) |
| ≥ 0.93.0 | not installed | ⚠ Core pg_ripple + IVM work; bidirectional relay unavailable |
| < 0.93.0 | any | pg_tide not yet supported (use pg_trickle ≤ 0.45.0 for relay) |

### Recommended stack (pg_ripple ≥ 0.93.0)

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_tide;      -- relay, outbox, inbox (trickle-labs/pg-tide ≥ 0.4.0)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle;   -- IVM (trickle-labs/pg-trickle ≥ 0.46.0)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple;    -- RDF triple store (≥ 0.93.0)
```

Call `pg_ripple.pg_tide_available()` to verify pg_tide is installed at runtime.
Call `pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available()` to verify pg_trickle is installed at runtime.
