# pg-tide Relay: Hub-and-Spoke Integration

> **Available since**: v0.52.0 (originally pg-trickle relay, migrated to pg-tide in v0.93.0)
>
> **Requires**: pg-tide ≥ 0.4.0 (relay CLI and outbox/inbox); pg_trickle ≥ 0.46.0 (IVM only); pg_ripple ≥ 0.93.0
>
> **Note**: pg-trickle v0.46.0 extracted the relay, outbox, and inbox subsystem into the
> standalone `pg_tide` extension (`trickle-labs/pg-tide`). After v0.46.0, pg_trickle provides
> IVM only. All relay functionality described here requires pg_tide ≥ 0.4.0.

## What this integration does

Imagine you have IoT sensor readings arriving via Kafka, customer records coming
in from a CRM webhook, and order data flowing through NATS — all using different
field names, different identifiers for the same real-world entities, and different
data shapes. Downstream teams want a clean, unified, enriched view of this data
pushed to their own systems in real time, without any of them having to understand
the messy source schemas.

This is the hub-and-spoke pattern. **pg-tide** acts as the transport network:
its relay CLI pulls data in from any source (Kafka, NATS, webhooks) and pushes
enriched data out to any sink. **pg_ripple** acts as the intelligent hub in the
middle: it turns the incoming JSON into a knowledge graph, runs inference rules to
derive new facts, validates data quality with SHACL, and serializes the enriched
results back to JSON or JSON-LD for downstream consumers. The output format is
flexible — simple decoded JSON (via raw CDC triggers) or shaped JSON-LD (via
framing triggers) — depending on what each downstream consumer needs.

The whole pipeline runs inside a single PostgreSQL database. Both extensions share
the same transaction context, so data moves from inbox to triplestore to outbox
without ever leaving the database process.

```

The data flow through the hub has five stages:

1. **Ingest** — pg-tide relay reverse mode delivers raw JSON events into inbox tables.
2. **Transform** — a trigger converts the JSON into RDF triples and loads them into the triplestore.
3. **Enrich** — Datalog inference rules derive new facts (alerts, entity links, risk scores).
4. **Validate** — SHACL shapes enforce data quality before anything leaves the hub.
5. **Distribute** — pg-tide relay forward mode pushes enriched, validated JSON events to any number of sinks.

## Prerequisites

You need three extensions installed in the same database. Install order matters —
pg_tide must be created before pg_trickle (which calls `tide.outbox_create()` via
`pgtrickle.attach_outbox()`), and both before pg_ripple:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_tide;      -- relay, outbox, inbox (trickle-labs/pg-tide ≥ 0.4.0)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trickle;   -- IVM only (grove/pg-trickle ≥ 0.46.0)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ripple;    -- RDF triple store (≥ 0.93.0)
```

If pg_tide is not installed, relay-dependent features are unavailable. pg_ripple
degrades gracefully: SPARQL views and IVM continue to work (they require pg_trickle,
not pg_tide), but outbox/inbox operations raise a descriptive error:

```
ERROR: pg_tide extension is not installed;
       install pg_tide ≥0.1.0 from https://github.com/trickle-labs/pg-tide
       then run: CREATE EXTENSION pg_tide
```

If pg_trickle is not installed, SPARQL/Datalog/CONSTRUCT views are unavailable:

```
WARNING: pg_trickle is not installed; CDC subscriptions are unavailable
```

Call `pg_ripple.pg_tide_available()` and `pg_ripple.pg_trickle_available()` at
runtime to check availability before calling relay or view functions.

---

## A worked example: IoT sensor hub

The following walkthrough builds a complete hub that ingests temperature readings
from IoT sensors on a Kafka topic (`iot.sensors`), detects anomalies using
inference rules, and publishes enriched alerts back to Kafka on a separate topic
(`iot.alerts`). The pipeline is intentionally symmetrical: the same broker and
format convention on both ends, with pg_ripple doing the enrichment in the
middle. Each step shows both the SQL to run and what the data looks like at that
point.

### Step 1 — Pull sensor events from Kafka

The relay process runs outside PostgreSQL and continuously polls configured
sources. You tell it what to poll and where to write the results using
`tide.relay_set_inbox()`. Here we subscribe to the `iot.sensors` Kafka
topic and direct its events into a table called `sensor_inbox`. Enriched alerts
will flow back out on the `iot.alerts` topic on the same broker — same system,
both ends:

```sql
SELECT tide.relay_set_inbox(
    'sensor-readings',
    'sensor_inbox',
    '{"brokers": "${env:KAFKA_BROKERS}", "topic": "iot.sensors"}'::jsonb,
    p_source := 'kafka'
);
```

The `${env:KAFKA_BROKERS}` syntax tells the relay to expand an environment variable
at runtime. Pipeline configs are stored in the database as JSONB, but sensitive
values like broker addresses can reference environment variables this way —
the actual value stays in the relay process's environment and never needs to be
stored in plaintext in the database.

Each time the relay receives a message from Kafka, it inserts a row into
`sensor_inbox`. The original Kafka message payload arrives as a `JSONB` column.
A typical row looks like this:

```json
{
  "event_id": "kafka:iot.sensors:0:42",
  "event_type": "sensor_reading",
  "payload": {
    "device": "sensor-7",
    "temp": 22.5,
    "unit": "°C",
    "ts": "2026-04-28T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 2 — Convert JSON events to RDF triples

Raw JSON has no standard semantics. Two sensor vendors might both call their
field `"temp"` but mean very different things. By converting to RDF we attach
well-defined, globally unique meanings to each field — in this case using the
[SAREF IoT ontology](https://saref.etsi.org/).

The `pg_ripple.json_to_ntriples_and_load()` function (v0.52.0+) does this in one
call. Its `context` parameter works like a JSON-LD `@context`: it maps the incoming
JSON field names to the full predicate IRIs you want to store. The relay delivers
plain JSON; the IRI mapping is applied at load time inside PostgreSQL, so the
original message is never modified.

A trigger on `sensor_inbox` fires for every inserted row:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION transform_sensor_to_rdf()
RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM pg_ripple.json_to_ntriples_and_load(
        payload     => NEW.payload,
        subject_iri => 'https://example.org/observation/' || NEW.event_id,
        type_iri    => 'https://saref.etsi.org/core/Measurement',
        context     => '{
            "@vocab":  "https://saref.etsi.org/core/",
            "device":  "https://saref.etsi.org/core/measurementMadeBy",
            "temp":    "https://saref.etsi.org/core/hasValue",
            "ts":      "https://saref.etsi.org/core/hasTimestamp",
            "unit":    "https://qudt.org/schema/qudt/unit"
        }'::jsonb
    );
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

CREATE TRIGGER sensor_to_rdf
AFTER INSERT ON sensor_inbox
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION transform_sensor_to_rdf();
```

The `context` object supports two resolution mechanisms:

- **`@vocab`** — a default IRI prefix applied to every unmapped key. Any field
  not explicitly listed gets expanded to `https://saref.etsi.org/core/{field}`.
- **Explicit entries** — override specific keys with the exact IRI you want,
  regardless of the `@vocab` default.

Nested JSON objects become blank nodes. Arrays produce one triple per element.
`null` values are silently skipped. This means you can point the relay at an
arbitrary third-party JSON event and describe the entire mapping in one JSONB
literal — no code changes needed when a vendor renames a field, only a context
update.

After the trigger fires, those five triples exist in the triplestore — one
`rdf:type` triple (from `type_iri`) and one for each of the four data fields in
the source JSON. If you queried them back as JSON-LD immediately after load, you
would see:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "saref": "https://saref.etsi.org/core/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "qudt": "https://qudt.org/schema/qudt/"
  },
  "@id": "https://example.org/observation/kafka:iot.sensors:0:42",
  "@type": "saref:Measurement",
  "saref:measurementMadeBy": {
    "@id": "https://example.org/device/sensor-7"
  },
  "saref:hasValue": {
    "@value": "22.5",
    "@type": "xsd:decimal"
  },
  "saref:hasTimestamp": {
    "@value": "2026-04-28T10:00:00Z",
    "@type": "xsd:dateTime"
  },
  "qudt:unit": "°C"
}
```

This is the data at rest inside the triplestore, expressed as JSON-LD. The
`@type` and `@id` fields carry the full semantic meaning from the SAREF ontology,
so any consumer that understands SAREF can correctly interpret the reading.

### Step 3 — Add inference rules to detect anomalies

Datalog rules let you express facts that can be *derived* from the stored
triples. Rather than writing triggers for every business rule, you declare the
rules once and pg_ripple materialises the inferred triples automatically.

The rules below fire an alert whenever a measurement exceeds 40°C and link
devices across sources that share a serial number (entity resolution):

```sql
SELECT pg_ripple.load_rules(
    rules    => $$
        % Derive an alert for any observation above the threshold.
        % Two triples are inferred per matching observation:
        %   <obs> ex:tempAlert <device>          — links observation to device
        %   <obs> ex:alertType "high_temperature" — records the alert category
        % Storing the alert type as a literal triple keeps the meaning inside
        % the triplestore rather than hardcoding it in downstream trigger code.
        ex:tempAlert(Obs, Device) :-
            saref:measurementMadeBy(Obs, Device),
            saref:hasValue(Obs, Val),
            Val > 40.0.

        ex:alertType(Obs, "high_temperature") :-
            saref:hasValue(Obs, Val),
            Val > 40.0.

        % Link two devices if they share a serial number, even if they
        % appear under different identifiers in different source systems.
        owl:sameAs(D1, D2) :-
            schema:serialNumber(D1, SN),
            schema:serialNumber(D2, SN),
            D1 \= D2.
    $$,
    rule_set => 'sensor_enrichment'
);
```

When a 45°C reading arrives from `sensor-7`, these rules materialise two new
triples — inferred facts that did not exist in the raw data:

```
<https://example.org/observation/kafka:iot.sensors:0:99>
    <https://example.org/tempAlert>
    <https://example.org/device/sensor-7> .

<https://example.org/observation/kafka:iot.sensors:0:99>
    <https://example.org/alertType>
    "high_temperature" .
```

### Step 4 — Enforce data quality with SHACL

Before enriched data leaves the hub, SHACL shapes act as a quality gate. Any
observation that lacks a `measurementMadeBy` link or a timestamp will fail
validation and be flagged rather than silently forwarded to downstream consumers:

```sql
SELECT pg_ripple.load_shacl($$
    @prefix sh:    <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
    @prefix saref: <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .
    @prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
    @prefix ex:    <https://example.org/> .

    ex:ObservationShape a sh:NodeShape ;
        sh:targetClass saref:Measurement ;
        sh:property [
            sh:path saref:measurementMadeBy ;
            sh:minCount 1 ;
            sh:maxCount 1 ;
            sh:message "Every measurement must reference exactly one device." ;
        ] ;
        sh:property [
            sh:path saref:hasTimestamp ;
            sh:minCount 1 ;
            sh:datatype xsd:dateTime ;
            sh:message "Every measurement must have an xsd:dateTime timestamp." ;
        ] .
$$);
```

### Step 5 — Route enriched events to downstream consumers

Now that observations are stored, enriched, and validated, we set up the outbound
pipeline. We create a bridge table to hold outbound events, subscribe to the
inferred alert triples, and configure relay forward pipelines to deliver them
wherever they are needed.

```sql
-- The bridge table holds the outbound alert payloads.
-- pg-trickle watches this table and relays its rows to external sinks.
CREATE TABLE enriched_events (
    id         BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload    JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Declare which triples the subscription should watch for.
-- Only triples where the predicate is ex:tempAlert will pass through.
SELECT pg_ripple.create_subscription(
    name          => 'high-temp-alerts',
    filter_sparql => 'FILTER(?p = <https://example.org/tempAlert>)'
);

-- Wire the subscription to the outbox table.
-- This installs a trigger on the VP delta table for ex:tempAlert; whenever a
-- matching triple lands, the trigger decodes it and writes a row to
-- enriched_events. That is the only writer to enriched_events in this pipeline.
SELECT pg_ripple.enable_cdc_bridge_trigger(
    name      => 'high-temp-alerts',
    predicate => 'https://example.org/tempAlert',
    outbox    => 'enriched_events'
);

-- Reformat the raw decoded triple into plain JSON before the row is committed.
-- The frame template is a static JSONB literal: the @context maps short
-- property names to the stored SAREF predicate IRIs, and the property slots
-- ({}) tell pg_ripple which predicates to pull. Only the @id is dynamic —
-- it scopes the generated CONSTRUCT query to this specific observation.
-- The final unwrap + strip step removes JSON-LD structural keywords so the
-- consumer receives the same plain JSON as before, but the output shape is
-- now fully described by the frame rather than hand-assembled field by field.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reformat_alert_payload()
RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    framed JSONB;
    item   JSONB;
BEGIN
    framed := pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed(
        frame => '{
            "@context": {
                "device": "https://saref.etsi.org/core/measurementMadeBy",
                "temp":   "https://saref.etsi.org/core/hasValue",
                "unit":   "https://qudt.org/schema/qudt/unit",
                "ts":     "https://saref.etsi.org/core/hasTimestamp",
                "alert":  "https://example.org/alertType"
            },
            "@type":  "https://saref.etsi.org/core/Measurement",
            "device": {},
            "temp":   {},
            "unit":   {},
            "ts":     {},
            "alert":  {}
        }'::jsonb || jsonb_build_object('@id', NEW.payload ->> 'subject')
    );

    -- @context lives at the top level of the framed document and is discarded
    -- automatically when we unwrap @graph. @type and @id sit on the node
    -- itself; strip them with the jsonb - operator to get plain JSON.
    item := (framed -> '@graph' -> 0) - '@type' - '@id';

    IF item IS NOT NULL THEN
        NEW.payload := item;
    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

CREATE TRIGGER reformat_alert
BEFORE INSERT ON enriched_events
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION reformat_alert_payload();

-- Create a pg_tide outbox so the relay can poll it.
-- pg_tide manages all outbox messages in tide.tide_outbox_messages;
-- triggers call tide.outbox_publish() instead of inserting into a bridge table.
SELECT tide.outbox_create(
    'enriched-events',
    p_retention_hours  := 24,
    p_inline_threshold := 0
);

-- Install a publish trigger so the relay picks up enriched_events rows.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION bridge_alert_to_tide_outbox()
RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM tide.outbox_publish(
        'enriched-events',
        jsonb_build_object(
            'subject',   pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.s),
            'predicate', pg_ripple.decode_id(TG_ARGV[0]::bigint),
            'object',    pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.o),
            'graph',     pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.g)
        ),
        '{}'::jsonb   -- headers
    );
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

Now configure the relay to forward those events back to Kafka on the `iot.alerts`
topic — the same broker the raw sensor readings came from:

```sql
-- Publish enriched alerts to iot.alerts on the same Kafka broker
SELECT tide.relay_set_outbox(
    'alerts-to-kafka',
    'enriched-events',
    'kafka',
    '{"brokers": "${env:KAFKA_BROKERS}", "topic": "iot.alerts"}'::jsonb
);
```

The same outbox can fan out to additional sinks without any changes to the
pg_ripple side — just register extra `relay_set_outbox` pipelines:

```sql
-- Also push to NATS for real-time dashboard consumers (optional)
SELECT tide.relay_set_outbox(
    'alerts-to-nats',
    'enriched-events',
    'nats',
    '{"url": "nats://nats:4222", "subject_template": "iot.alerts.{event_type}"}'::jsonb
);

-- Or to a partner API via webhook (optional)
SELECT tide.relay_set_outbox(
    'alerts-to-partner',
    'enriched-events',
    'webhook',
    '{"url": "https://partner.example.com/events", "method": "POST"}'::jsonb
);
```

The `reformat_alert_payload` trigger produces the same plain JSON as the
previous `jsonb_build_object` version, but the entire output shape is now
described by the static frame template — including the `alert` field. The
`ex:alertType` literal triple was inferred by the Datalog rule in Step 3, so
the frame simply maps the short name `"alert"` to that predicate and picks it
up like any other property; there is nothing to hardcode in the trigger. The
`||` appends only the dynamic `@id` to scope the generated CONSTRUCT query to
this specific observation. Two steps then strip the JSON-LD structural
keywords: `-> '@graph' -> 0` unwraps the node and discards the top-level
`@context`; `- '@type' - '@id'` removes the remaining keywords from the node.
A consumer reading from `iot.alerts` sees a plain JSON document it can process
without any knowledge of RDF or the triplestore:

```json
{
  "device": "sensor-7",
  "temp":   45.2,
  "unit":   "°C",
  "ts":     "2026-04-28T10:00:00Z",
  "alert":  "high_temperature"
}
```

Compare this with the original inbound message from Step 1: same field names
(`device`, `temp`, `unit`, `ts`), one new `alert` field derived by the inference
rules. The values here come from a different observation (the 45.2°C reading
that triggered the alert), but the shape is identical. The triplestore and
Datalog engine are invisible to both the producer and the consumer — they see
only ordinary JSON.

---

## Choosing a CDC bridge approach

Step 5 used `enable_cdc_bridge_trigger` (Approach A below) — the simplest
option, with latency under 10 ms. Two other approaches offer different
trade-offs for different data paths in the same hub. All three write to the
same `enriched_events` outbox table; only the *mechanism* that detects new
triples and writes outbox rows differs.

### Approach A — Trigger bridge (lowest latency, < 10 ms)

The simplest approach: a trigger on VP delta tables fires in the same
transaction that inserted the triple. The triple is decoded from its internal
integer representation and written directly to the bridge table before the
transaction commits. Nothing can slip through — the data is in both places or
neither:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _pg_ripple.bridge_to_outbox()
RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO enriched_events (event_type, payload)
    VALUES (
        TG_OP,
        jsonb_build_object(
            'subject',   pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.s),
            'predicate', pg_ripple.decode_id(TG_ARGV[0]::bigint),
            'object',    pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.o),
            'graph',     pg_ripple.decode_id(NEW.g)
        )
    );
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

The `pg_ripple.enable_cdc_bridge_trigger()` call in Step 5 installs exactly
this pattern automatically — you do not need to write the trigger function by
hand. The raw `{subject, predicate, object, graph}` payload is useful on its
own, but you can also reshape it before it leaves the outbox:

- **Plain JSON via framing** — add a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger that calls
  `export_jsonld_framed()` with the desired `@context`, unwraps `@graph`, and
  strips `@type` and `@id` with the jsonb `-` operator, as Step 5 does with
  `reformat_alert_payload()`. This is more declarative than building the payload
  manually with `jsonb_build_object` — changing an outbound property name is a
  one-line `@context` edit rather than a code change.
- **Full JSON-LD** — store the framed document directly without stripping (see
  [Outbound framing](#json-ld-mapping-inbound-context-and-outbound-framing)).

**Best for**: High-priority alerts, strict transactional guarantees.  
**Trade-off**: `decode_id()` is called once per row, which adds overhead on high-volume
write paths. For filtering — forwarding only alerts and not every measurement — you
need an extra `WHERE` condition in the trigger.

### Approach B — Background worker bridge (best throughput, 50–500 ms)

The pg_ripple background worker (enabled since v0.52.0) wakes up when it
receives CDC `NOTIFY` events, collects a batch of them, decodes all the integer
dictionary IDs in a single bulk SPI call, and inserts the decoded rows into the
bridge table in one go. The amortised cost per triple is much lower than the
trigger approach, and the batch size and flush interval are configurable.

This approach adds a small latency window (the batch collection time), but for
high-volume enriched-data streams — thousands of triples per second — the
throughput improvement is significant. Use this as the default for bulk data paths.

**Best for**: Bulk enriched data, high-volume streams.  
**Trade-off**: Adds configurable milliseconds of latency.

### Approach C — Named subscription with SPARQL CONSTRUCT view (most flexible)

Named subscriptions (v0.42.0+) let you attach a SPARQL `FILTER` expression
that controls exactly which triples are bridged. Only the triples that match
the filter expression will ever touch the outbox, which is useful when the
inference rules produce many intermediate triples that you do not want to
forward:

```sql
-- Only bridge the final alert triples, not intermediate inference steps
SELECT pg_ripple.create_subscription(
    name          => 'alerts',
    filter_sparql => 'FILTER(?p = <https://example.org/tempAlert>)'
);
```

Combine this with `export_jsonld_framed()` to shape the outbound payload into
exactly the JSON structure the downstream consumer expects. A JSON-LD **frame**
is a template you write once that describes the desired nesting and field names.
pg_ripple translates it to a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query internally, executes it,
applies the W3C embedding algorithm, and compacts the result with your `@context`:

```sql
SELECT pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed(
    frame => '{
        "@context": {
            "ex":     "https://example.org/",
            "schema": "https://schema.org/",
            "saref":  "https://saref.etsi.org/core/",
            "xsd":    "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
            "alertLevel": "ex:alertLevel",
            "name":       "schema:name",
            "latestTemp": "ex:latestTemp"
        },
        "@type": "ex:Alert",
        "alertLevel": {},
        "name": {},
        "latestTemp": {}
    }'::jsonb
);
```

The framed output is a clean, nested JSON-LD document ready to drop straight
into the pg-trickle outbox:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "ex":     "https://example.org/",
    "schema": "https://schema.org/",
    "xsd":    "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "alertLevel": "ex:alertLevel",
    "name":       "schema:name",
    "latestTemp": "ex:latestTemp"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id":       "https://example.org/device/sensor-7",
      "@type":     "ex:Alert",
      "alertLevel": "HIGH",
      "name":       "Boiler Room Sensor 7",
      "latestTemp": { "@value": "45.2", "@type": "xsd:decimal" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `jsonld_frame_to_sparql(frame => ...)` to inspect the generated CONSTRUCT
query before running the full export — this is useful for performance tuning.

**Best for**: Complex SPARQL-shaped payloads, scheduled reports, ad-hoc shapes.  
**Trade-off**: Polling-based unless combined with a LISTEN/NOTIFY wake-up.

### Which approach to use

In practice you will use all three for different data paths in the same hub:

| Data path | Mechanism | Typical latency |
|---|---|---|
| High-priority alerts | Approach A — trigger bridge | < 10 ms |
| Bulk enriched data | Approach B — background worker | 50–500 ms |
| Shaped reports / views | Approach C — SPARQL CONSTRUCT | Cron-driven |

---

## Common patterns

### Unifying records from multiple sources

A real hub almost always receives data about the same real-world entities from
multiple systems — a customer appears in the CRM as `crm:C1` and in the ERP as
`erp:A1`, but they are the same person. Datalog `owl:sameAs` rules detect these
overlaps from shared attributes (email address, serial number, phone number) and
create linking triples that allow downstream SPARQL queries to treat both records
as one:

```prolog
% Link CRM and ERP records that share an email address
owl:sameAs(CrmCust, ErpAcct) :-
    crm:emailAddress(CrmCust, E),
    erp:contact_email(ErpAcct, E).
```

Once those `owl:sameAs` triples are materialised, pg_ripple's OWL RL
canonicalisation ensures that any query for `crm:C1` will transparently find
data originally stored under `erp:A1` as well.

### Speaking a common language to downstream consumers

Each source system uses its own property names. Your CRM calls it
`crm:customerName`; the ERP calls it `erp:accountTitle`. Rather than
requiring every downstream consumer to understand every source vocabulary,
Datalog rules project everything onto a single shared ontology (here, Schema.org):

```prolog
% Both CRM and ERP names map to schema:name
schema:name(X, V)  :- crm:customerName(X, V).
schema:name(X, V)  :- erp:accountTitle(X, V).

% Both email fields map to schema:email
schema:email(X, V) :- crm:emailAddress(X, V).
schema:email(X, V) :- erp:contact_email(X, V).
```

Downstream consumers now only need to understand Schema.org. Source schema
changes are isolated to a single Datalog rule update in the hub — no downstream
changes required.

### Rich JSON-LD for event-driven downstream consumers

Here is what a fully enriched and shaped customer record looks like by the time
it reaches a downstream consumer via the relay. Notice how all the messy
source-system vocabulary has been replaced with clean Schema.org terms, and the
document is self-describing thanks to the `@context`:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "schema": "https://schema.org/",
    "ex":     "https://example.org/",
    "xsd":    "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
  },
  "@id":   "https://example.org/customer/C1",
  "@type": "schema:Customer",
  "schema:name":  "Jane Doe",
  "schema:email": "jane@example.com",
  "ex:riskScore": { "@value": "0.87", "@type": "xsd:decimal" },
  "ex:highValueCustomer": true,
  "owl:sameAs": [
    { "@id": "https://erp.example.com/accounts/A1" },
    { "@id": "https://support.example.com/tickets/T9" }
  ],
  "_relay_dedup_key": "ripple:4200042"
}
```

The `owl:sameAs` array shows the entity resolution result — this one record
links the CRM, ERP, and support-ticket identities together. The `ex:riskScore`
was derived by a Datalog rule from order history data.

The `_relay_dedup_key` is a convention for idempotent delivery: its value is
derived from pg_ripple's internal statement ID (the `i` column in VP tables),
so downstream consumers can detect and discard duplicates even if the relay
restarts and replays part of the outbox. Including it is optional — the worked
example above omits it because the plain-JSON reformat trigger does not add it,
but it is straightforward to include via
`'_relay_dedup_key', 'ripple:' || NEW.i` in the `jsonb_build_object` call.

## JSON-LD mapping: inbound context and outbound framing

JSON-LD mapping is the mechanism that lets pg_ripple act as a true semantic
bridge: arbitrary JSON goes in, canonicalised knowledge graph triples are stored,
and shaped JSON-LD comes out. The inbound and outbound sides each have a dedicated
function.

### Inbound — `json_to_ntriples_and_load()` with a context map

When the relay delivers a raw JSON event, `pg_ripple.json_to_ntriples_and_load()`
converts it to RDF triples in one step. The `context` parameter is a JSONB object
that works like a JSON-LD `@context`:

```
Incoming JSON                    context map                     stored triples
─────────────                    ───────────                     ──────────────
{ "temp": 45.2, "device": ... }  "temp"  → saref:hasValue   →   <obs> saref:hasValue "45.2"^^xsd:decimal
                                 "device"→ saref:madeby      →   <obs> saref:madeby <device-7>
                                 @vocab  → saref:             →   unmapped keys get saref: prefix
```

It supports:
- **`@vocab`** — default IRI prefix for all keys not explicitly listed.
- **Explicit key-to-IRI mappings** — override specific fields with exact predicate IRIs.
- **Nested objects** — become blank nodes with their own predicates resolved through the same context.
- **Arrays** — produce one triple per element.
- **`null` values** — silently skipped.

The context is stored only in the trigger definition, not in the triplestore. When
a source vendor renames a field, you update the context JSONB; no triples need to
change.

```sql
-- Full context example for a heterogeneous event shape
PERFORM pg_ripple.json_to_ntriples_and_load(
    payload     => NEW.payload,
    subject_iri => 'https://example.org/event/' || NEW.event_id,
    type_iri    => 'https://schema.org/Event',
    context     => '{
        "@vocab":      "https://schema.org/",
        "ts":          "https://schema.org/startDate",
        "location":    "https://schema.org/location",
        "description": "https://schema.org/description",
        "external_id": "https://example.org/externalId"
    }'::jsonb
);
```

### Outbound — `export_jsonld_framed()` with a frame template

On the way out, `pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed()` (v0.17.0+) shapes the flat
RDF into whatever nested JSON structure the downstream consumer expects. A
**frame** is a JSON template that describes the desired structure; pg_ripple
handles everything else:

1. Translates the frame into a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query.
2. Executes the query against the triplestore.
3. Applies the W3C JSON-LD 1.1 embedding algorithm to produce nested nodes.
4. Compacts IRI strings using the frame's `@context`.

```
stored triples               frame template                  outbound JSON-LD
──────────────               ──────────────                  ───────────────
<device> schema:name "X"     "@type": "schema:Device"        { "@type": "Device",
<device> ex:temp 45.2        "name": {},                →      "name": "X",
<device> ex:alert "HIGH"     "temp": {},                       "temp": 45.2,
                             "alert": {}                        "alert": "HIGH" }
```

Use this inside the outbox bridge trigger to produce consumer-ready JSON-LD:

```sql
-- Write a framed JSON-LD event to the outbox every time an alert triple lands
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION bridge_alert_to_outbox()
RETURNS TRIGGER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    framed JSONB;
BEGIN
    framed := pg_ripple.export_jsonld_framed(
        frame => '{
            "@context": {
                "schema": "https://schema.org/",
                "ex":     "https://example.org/",
                "xsd":    "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
                "name":       "schema:name",
                "latestTemp": "ex:latestTemp",
                "alertLevel": "ex:alertLevel"
            },
            "@type": "ex:Alert",
            "name": {},
            "latestTemp": {},
            "alertLevel": {}
        }'::jsonb
    );

    INSERT INTO enriched_events (event_type, payload)
    VALUES ('alert', framed);

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

The downstream consumer receives a document shaped exactly to the frame — with
short, readable property names from the `@context`, nested objects where the
frame requests them, and a self-describing `@context` block so it can be parsed
without any knowledge of pg_ripple's internals.

If the downstream consumer expects plain JSON rather than JSON-LD, strip the
structural keywords before inserting into the outbox:

```sql
-- @context is at the top level; -> '@graph' -> 0 discards it automatically.
-- @type and @id live on the node; chain - to remove them in one expression.
item := (framed -> '@graph' -> 0) - '@type' - '@id';

INSERT INTO enriched_events (event_type, payload)
VALUES ('alert', item);
```

The jsonb `-` operator accepts either a single key (`- '@type'`) or a text
array (`- ARRAY['@type','@id']`) to remove several keywords at once.

### Debugging the frame translation

Before running `export_jsonld_framed()` in production, use
`jsonld_frame_to_sparql()` to see the SPARQL CONSTRUCT query that will be
generated. This is useful for verifying that the frame matches your stored
triple shapes and for identifying any missing patterns before they cause
silent empty results:

```sql
SELECT pg_ripple.jsonld_frame_to_sparql(
    frame => '{
        "@context": { "schema": "https://schema.org/" },
        "@type":    "schema:Device",
        "schema:name": {}
    }'::jsonb
);
```

### Symmetric round-trip

The two functions form a symmetric pair: `json_to_ntriples_and_load()` maps
field names from the source JSON vocabulary to RDF predicates on the way in;
`export_jsonld_framed()` maps those same predicates back to the field names and
nested structure the consumer needs on the way out. You can use different
`@context` definitions for different consumers — the triplestore is the stable
canonical representation in the middle, and the vocabularies at each edge are
entirely configurable.

---

## Deployment

All three extensions run in the same PostgreSQL instance. The `pg-tide-relay`
binary is a separate, stateless process. A single relay instance handles **both
directions** — inbound pipelines (external source → inbox table) and outbound
pipelines (outbox table → external sink) run in the same process. You do not need
separate relay binaries for each direction.

For high availability, run two or three relay instances pointing at the same
PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL advisory locks elect exactly one owner per
pipeline — if one instance dies, another acquires its pipelines on the next
discovery interval.

The relay only needs one environment variable to start: the database URL.
All pipeline configuration is registered in the database via SQL
(`tide.relay_set_outbox()` / `tide.relay_set_inbox()`), and the relay reads it on
startup and hot-reloads it when you make changes — no restart required.

Sensitive values like broker addresses can use `${env:VAR}` placeholders inside
the JSONB config. The relay expands them from its own process environment at
runtime, so credentials never need to be stored in the database.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml sketch
services:
  postgres:
    image: ghcr.io/grove/pg-ripple:latest
    # pg_ripple, pg_trickle, pg_tide, PostGIS, and pgvector all pre-installed

  relay:
    image: ghcr.io/trickle-labs/pg-tide-relay:0.4.0
    environment:
      PG_TIDE_RELAY_POSTGRES_URL: postgres://relay:pw@postgres/hub
      # All pipeline config (topics, subjects, poll intervals) lives in the DB.
      # Broker addresses can use ${env:VAR} refs — set them here as env vars.
      # Register pipelines with tide.relay_set_outbox() / tide.relay_set_inbox().
      KAFKA_BROKERS: kafka:9092   # expanded by ${env:KAFKA_BROKERS} in pipeline config
      NATS_URL: nats://nats:4222  # similarly available via ${env:NATS_URL}
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"   # Prometheus metrics + /health endpoint

  pg-ripple-http:
    image: pg-ripple-http:latest
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://ripple:pw@postgres/hub
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    # SPARQL endpoint for ad-hoc queries from dashboards and tools

  kafka:
    image: redpandadata/redpanda:latest

  nats:
    image: nats:latest
    command: ["-js"]   # JetStream enabled for durable subscriptions
```

For Kubernetes deployments, the relay's `/health` endpoint integrates with
readiness probes. See [Kubernetes & Helm](kubernetes.md) for a full Helm
chart example.

---

## Things to watch out for

### Outbox growing faster than it drains (backpressure)

When a single inbound event triggers many inferred triples — for example, an
`owl:sameAs` merge that touches hundreds of related facts — the outbox can
accumulate rows faster than the relay drains them. Three controls help:

- Use **pg_tide's retention drain** (`tide.outbox_create(retention_hours => N)`) to cap
  outbox size and drop the oldest rows once a maximum depth is reached.
- Use the relay's `/health` endpoint as a Kubernetes readiness probe. When the
  relay falls behind, it signals not-ready, letting the cluster apply
  back-pressure to inbound sources.
- Use pg_ripple's `source` column to bridge only explicit triples (`source = 0`)
  and suppress inferred triples (`source = 1`) from a particular outbox, reducing
  volume without changing the inference rules.

### Keeping consumers in sync after rule changes

When you update a Datalog rule or SHACL shape — adding a new derived property,
changing a threshold — downstream consumers are receiving a different data
shape than before. Manage this with:

- **Version the subject template** in the relay outbox configuration:
  `ripple.v2.enriched.{type}` rather than `ripple.enriched.{type}`.
- **Include a `@context` version** field in outbound JSON-LD payloads so
  consumers can detect schema changes programmatically.
- **Use the relay's full-refresh mode** to re-snapshot the entire outbox
  after a rule change, ensuring consumers that missed the transition catch up.

## Bidirectional CRM ⇄ ERP Walkthrough (v0.77.0)

> **Available since**: v0.77.0

v0.77.0 adds the generic bidirectional integration primitives that make it
possible to build a two-way relay between any two systems through pg_ripple.
This walkthrough uses a CRM ⇄ ERP scenario as the concrete example.

### Topology

```
  CRM (source of truth       ERP (source of truth
   for email/phone)           for tax ID/status)
       │                           │

          (source_priority)

  CRM outbox               ERP outbox
  (pg-tide)                (pg-tide)
```

### Step 1: Register mappings with default graph IRIs

```sql
-- CRM mapping: contacts
SELECT pg_ripple.register_json_mapping(
    'crm_contact',
    '{"@context": {
        "ex:name":    "http://schema.org/name",
        "ex:email":   "http://schema.org/email",
        "ex:phone":   "http://schema.org/telephone"
    }}'::jsonb,
    default_graph_iri   => '<urn:source:crm>',
    timestamp_path      => '$.lastModified',
    iri_template        => 'https://crm.example.com/contacts/{id}'
);

-- ERP mapping: employees
SELECT pg_ripple.register_json_mapping(
    'erp_employee',
    '{"@context": {
        "ex:name":   "http://schema.org/name",
        "ex:taxId":  "http://schema.org/taxID",
        "ex:status": "http://schema.org/employmentType"
    }}'::jsonb,
    default_graph_iri   => '<urn:source:erp>',
    timestamp_path      => '$.updatedAt',
    iri_template        => 'https://erp.example.com/employees/{id}'
);
```

### Step 2: Declare conflict resolution policies

```sql
-- Email: CRM is authoritative
SELECT pg_ripple.register_conflict_policy(
    'http://schema.org/email',
    'source_priority',
    '{"order": ["<urn:source:crm>", "<urn:source:erp>"]}'::jsonb
);

-- Name: last-write wins across both systems
SELECT pg_ripple.register_conflict_policy(
    'http://schema.org/name',
    'latest_wins'
);

-- Tax ID: ERP is sole source; reject any CRM attempt
SELECT pg_ripple.register_conflict_policy(
    'http://schema.org/taxID',
    'reject_on_conflict'
);
```

### Step 3: Ingest payloads

```sql
-- Ingest a CRM contact update (diff mode: derives per-triple timestamps)
SELECT pg_ripple.ingest_json(
    '{"ex:name": "Alice Smith", "ex:email": "alice@crm.example.com"}'::jsonb,
    'https://crm.example.com/contacts/42',
    'crm_contact',
    mode => 'diff'
);

-- Ingest the matching ERP employee (upsert mode: replaces sh:maxCount 1 fields)
SELECT pg_ripple.ingest_json(
    '{"ex:name": "Alice Smith", "ex:taxId": "123-45-6789"}'::jsonb,
    'https://erp.example.com/employees/E-999',
    'erp_employee',
    mode => 'upsert'
);
```

### Step 4: Cross-source entity linking (BIDI-REF-01)

After the ERP confirms Alice is the same person as CRM contact 42:

```sql
-- Record the linkback: CRM hub IRI ↔ ERP employee IRI
SELECT pg_ripple.record_linkback(
    'event-uuid-from-outbox'::uuid,
    target_iri => 'https://erp.example.com/employees/E-999'
);
```

This writes `<https://crm.example.com/contacts/42> owl:sameAs <https://erp.example.com/employees/E-999>` into the target graph and flushes any buffered events.

### Step 5: Loop-safe subscriptions (BIDI-LOOP-01)

When creating subscriptions, use `exclude_graphs` to prevent echo loops:

```sql
-- CRM subscription: exclude CRM's own graph to prevent loop
SELECT pg_ripple.create_subscription(
    'crm_contact_sync',
    outbox_table => 'pg_ripple_outbox.crm_contact_events'
    -- Note: exclude_graphs and propagation_depth are set via the
    -- _pg_ripple.subscriptions table after creation:
    -- UPDATE _pg_ripple.subscriptions
    --   SET exclude_graphs = ARRAY['<urn:source:crm>'],
    --       propagation_depth = 1
    -- WHERE name = 'crm_contact_sync';
);
```

### Step 6: Observe per-graph metrics (BIDI-OBS-01)

```sql
SELECT graph_iri, triple_count, last_write_at, conflicts_total
FROM pg_ripple.graph_stats()
ORDER BY triple_count DESC;
```

### Outbound event wire format (BIDI-WIRE-01)

Every event emitted to an outbox table follows this shape:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "subscription": "crm_contact_sync",
  "subject": "https://crm.example.com/contacts/42",
  "source_graph": "urn:source:crm",
  "after": {
    "http://schema.org/name": "Alice Smith",
    "http://schema.org/email": "alice@crm.example.com"
  },
  "base": {
    "http://schema.org/name": "Alice"
  },
  "subject_resolved": true
}
```

The `base` object carries the previous values for changed predicates, enabling
compare-and-swap (CAS) safety at the receiving system. See
`assert_cas(event, actual)` for a built-in CAS helper.

The full JSON Schema is at `docs/src/operations/event-schema-v1.json`.
